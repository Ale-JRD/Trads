# **Legend Chapter 737**

「Please wait here a little while. You may use the things in the room, but please don’t break anything.」

Rei looked around the room as Widele spoke.

It was a simple cabin that one would never expect to find inside the castle of such a powerful country like the Bestir Empire.

(Is this what they would call a log house?)

The exterior, which was built from logs, exactly matched what Rei imagined a log house to be.

The inside was also built to match the exterior.

「Well, it really is a building that doesn’t suit a castle.」

「That may be true. But, in the first place, it was built as a place for Princess Frizione to relax at when she was tired. If she wants to do that, it wouldn’t be relaxing if it were as luxurious as the castle, right?」

「…I guess so.」

Rei had a lot thoughts in his mind, but there was no point in saying it out loud. On the contrary, it might even cause a rift between him and Widele if she perceived his words to be making fun of Frizione.

Considering that, he wasn’t in a position to make careless remarks.

「As for food…I have some dried fruits and nuts, so you can eat those until I can call for Frizione-sama. I’ll arrange for some food to be brought over, but…well, you have an item box, Rei-sama, so you probably don’t need to eat those if you don’t want to.」

「Really? I actually quite like nuts and dried fruit. Anyway, I just have to quietly stay here until you come back?」

「Yes, please. Please don’t leave the cabin.」

「The cabin…huh.」

Looking around, Rei nodded in agreement.

「I understand. I’m a bit tired, so it would be good to relax.」

「Tired, Rei-sama? You’re saying some interesting things again.」

「…I should say that it’s not like I never get tired. Despite how I look right now, I’m quite tired.」

Rei spoke as he looked over at a sofa in the room.

Just as he said, Rei did feel slight fatigue.

However, the cause of his fatigue wasn’t physical. It was due to his previous encounter with Kabajid.

A mysterious man. That was Rei’s impression of Kabajid.

Rei wondered if his true identity had been seen through or not.

(No, he has probably realised…I think.)

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have gone out of his way to talk about Rhodes.

(But, considering that, he hasn’t bothered with me at all after that…why?)

He wondered, but there was no one who could answer.

「I see. Then get some rest. I will deliver Prince Mercurio’s letter to Princess Frizione and give my report. I think she will probably come over around evening…」

Rei nodded in understanding.

It wasn’t just the letter or the information Widele had learned at the rebel camp. There was much more that needed to be shared and discussed.

In particular, one of the conditions that Mercurio had set for Frizione to join him was that she had to serve under him. Even Rei, who wasn’t very knowledgeable about politics, knew that this would be a big point of contention.

Naturally Widele understood that as well. To be honest, she would much rather just laze around here like Rei.

But, as someone who served Frizione, is was something she couldn’t do and she eventually left the cabin.

「Well then…I guess I’ll take it easy for now.」

Muttering to himself, he lay down on the sofa, showing off to the gazes directed at him.

Rei had noticed those gazes before he entered the cabin. It had started as soon as he had reached this general area.

However, the gazes hadn’t been particularly hostile or murderous, so he reached the conclusion that they were the ones who took care of the cabin…in other words, people under Frizione’s control. As a result, he relaxed himself without minding the gazes.

He was a member of the rebel army…and someone considered to be their greatest strength. As such a person, now present in the Imperial Capital, Rei had expected that he would be kept under observation…

(If you looked at it from another perspective, they probably serve as guards as well. So as long as they don’t do anything unnecessary, it will be to my advantage.)

Rei muttered to himself as he enjoyed the soft sofa.

「I have to say, it really is soft. It feels like my body is sinking into it, or rather, it’s barely supporting my weight…I guess it’s worthy of something being used by royalty.」

It was so comfortable that he wanted to give himself over to the sofa and take a nap.

But, as he was currently in enemy territory, he couldn’t be that careless.

Resisting the urge to close his eyes, Rei decided that he would definitely fall asleep if he stayed on the sofa and hurriedly got up.

Even so, his sleepiness wasn’t something that would go away that easily.

Furthermore, as a cabin built for Frizione to relax on her own, it was naturally built to facilite that.

It had to have been designed to easily spend time here.

Convinced that he would still fall asleep if things remained as they were, Rei opened a window to try to wash away the sleepiness that was starting to hit him.

A cool autumn breeze blew in.

Unlike warm spring breezes, the cool wind didn’t make him sleepy but woke him up instead. Rei squinted his eyes as he looked around.

Gazing at the trees that had started to change to autumn colours, he glanced over at a guard who was pretending to be a gardener as they blended in with the trees.

(No, he’s not pretending. He’s probably a real gardener as well. More like a guard and a gardener.)

As a gardener, they would be able to freely roam around the castle. It wouldn’t be unusual for them to be carrying some sort of bladed tool around at the same time.

Along with those vague thoughts, he thought of the Oniwaban, a ground of undercover agents who served under the direct command of the shogun back in Japan.

He only remembered them from a TV show or something, but it was probably something similar.

(These guys must have been the ones staring at me.)

Rei thought to himself as he waved his hand lightly towards the gardener, who bowed towards him.

That said, as he had thought about earlier, it wasn’t a bad thing as they were closer to being his bodyguards in this situation, as long as he didn’t do anything careless.

Especailly since Kabajid might have seen through him.

「…Even so, there’s nothing to do here.」

It wasn’t possible for him to train and it was dangerous to sleep.

There wasn’t a need to maintain his weapons and armour either as long as only used the Death Scythe and Dragon Robe.

「Even if I want to play any games, I’m alone.」

Rei wished that Set could be here at this time, but it would be impossible to play Set’s favourite game either…throwing a wooden stick as far as he could for Set to retrieve.

Thinking about it, he decided that he should at least eat something, before he remembered that he hadn’t actually had lunch yet.

「I’m sure Widele said that it would be okay to eat anything inside this cabin. Since this cabin is used by the Princess, there should be something here, right?」

Muttering to himself, Rei started to search around.

It was only a single room cabin. There wasn’t anything like a kitchen, so it didn’t take much time to search the place.

As expected, he found a box of dried fruits in a corner of a cabin.

However, what surprised Rei more than finding the dried fruit was the dried meat close to it.

The fact that there was dried meat wasn’t surprising in of itself.

However, the fact that this cabin was built for Frizione meant that this dried meat was also intended for Frizione to eat.

「,,,,,,Does the First Princess also eat dried meat?」

Thinking about it rationally, it wasn’t a surprising fact.

But still, a princess eating dried meat didn’t quite seem to match in his mind.

「Well, she is Vihera’s older sister, so it’s possible they have a similar sense of taste.」

He had traveled together with Vihera and shared meals on many occasions.

Recalling that Vihera had regularly eaten dried meat then, it no longer seemed strange to him that the First Princess might also have a preference for dried meat.

Thinking that, he returned to the sofa as he used a knife that was inside the box to cut the dried meat into bite sized pieces before popping them into his mouth.

「…This is…」

Those were the only words Rei could speak.

The most delicious thing Rei had ever eaten had been the dried meat from the Eternal Sky Pavilion.

The dried meat from there was made with a generous amount of spices and a pickling sauce made from countless fruits, the meat of a high ranking monster, and a magic item designed to make dried meat.

Naturally, it costed a fair amount of money, but Rei wasn’t someone who was short on money and felt that it was worth more than its price.

But…the dried meat he had just eaten was clearly even better than the ones made in the Eternal Sky Pavilion.

The flavour of the meat and the taste of the various spices and fruits spread through his mouth without overpowering the rich taste of the meat. No, on the contrary, it felt like the flavours enhanced each other inside his mouth.

Dried meat…yes, it was only dried meat, the but delicious taste rivaled that of a main dish from a high class restaurant.

Next, he reached for the dried fruit, which also turned out to be very good.

It had a sweet taste, but didn’t linger in his mouth. The rich sweetness spread through his mouth before changing to a slight sour taste.

It was just one piece of fruit, but the taste changed with each bite.

It was also the most delicious dried fruit Rei had ever tasted.

「Appearance aside, the taste is beyond belief. As expected of something only royalty can eat.」

Rei muttered to himself as he reluctantly put down the piece of dried meat he had been holding onto the table near the sofa…

「Don’t you think so?」

He called out towards the door to the cabin.

After a few seconds, the door opened without a word.

On the other side of the door was a person taller than Rei and relatively tall for a woman.

In her hands, she held a plate covered with cloth.

「It doesn’t seem like you’re an assassin or anything like that. Your way of hiding your presence is too poor.」

「I see, it seems I need to train. …Let give my greetings first. I am Angela Luxinova, the leader of the White Rose Knights. I’ve heard that you’ve been a great help to Widele and my subordinates, Rei-sama…thank you.」

「No, don’t worry about ti. It’s true that we’ve benefited from it in various ways. And, it’s thanks to Widle that I was able to come to the Imperial Capital.」

「Fufu, you certainly seem to have the personality that Widele told me about. I’m still a noble after all.」

Although Angela said she was a noble, the expression on her face showed that she was rather interested by Rei’s seeming lack of care for the matter.

(According to Widele’s report, Her Highness Vihera has feelings for Rei-sama. I see, perhaps it is precisely because of this personality that Her Highness Vihera and Rei-sama get along so well.)

Considering Vihera’s personality, Angela seemed convinced that she would get along well with Rei.

As she nodded with a small smile, Rei seemed puzzled over what she was smiling about and spoke up.

「So, what’s the leader of the White Rose Knights doing here? Well, I was feeling quite bored, so you’re more than welcome here. You didn’t come here to kill time though, did you?」

「Yes. I’m not that bored after all. I brought some food for Rei-sama, but…it seems you’ve managed by yourself. …That said, those are reserved for Princess Frizione, so I would prefer it if you didn’t eat them.」

「…I guess it was expensive stuff after all. It’s understandable if it’s this delicious. …But, it was just left lying there.」

Angela turned her gaze to the dried meat and fruit on the talbe and her smile turned into a bitter one as she entered the cabin.

「Well, that can’t be helped. This cabin was originally prepared for Princess Frizione’s use alone. …If you could, please eat this instead of the dried meat.」

A plate filled with sandwiches was placed onto the table.

Although there were enough sandwiches for three people, to Rei, it was more of a snack.

「Princess Frizione is currently considering the matter she heard from Widele. I believe she will be able to come here sometime today, but…」

「It will take a while, huh.」

Rei reached for a sandwich as Angela nodded at his words.

# **Chapter 738**

Going back a little while in time.

Frizione was meeting with Widele and Angela in what could be called a private room.

The reason why Frizione was listening to Widele’s report in a room like this rather than an office like Shurus and Kabajid was simply because Frizione didn’t hold an official role like her brother.

As the First Princess, Frizione studied culture, hosted tea parties for the children of nobles, and played a general role of someone in high society, but she didn’t have a clearly defined job.

However, as politics were often discussed and decided by high society, it could be said that Frizione was quite involved in the politics of the Bestir Empire.

Frizione’s usually gentle smile stiffened slightly as she read through the letter from Mercurio that Widele handed over to her…

Angela wondered what the letter said, but Widele could roughly guess.

She expected that what was written was what Mercurio had told her about becoming his subordinate.

(Princess Frizione’s aim was to create a military stalemate between the rebel army and punitive force by cooperating with the rebel army. Then, when neither side could make a move, she would step in to mediate between them. That had been her aim. However…)

From the very beginning, the rebel army, including Mercurio, had never considered repairing relations with the punitive force…Shurus and Kabajid.

For Mercurio, the current situation was both a crisis and an opportunity.

Considering the current succession rights, if things continued peacefully, it was highly unlikely that Mercurio would become the emperor.

That was why he wanted to settle things clearly here and now, eliminating those above him.

That said, even Mercurio didn’t intend to kill his brothers.

To be honest, it would be best for him if his brothers would take their own lives, but if that did happen, the the First and Second Princes’ factions would undoubtedly cause a commotion, leading to a slugfest of a civil war that would be even worse than the current rebellion.

To prevent that, he would have to capture his two brothers without taking their lives. At the very least, he believed it would best to have them govern a remote territory.

But, to reach that point, he needed an overwhelming victory.

Frizione had previously thought that the rebel army led by Mercurio wouldn’t be able to do that, but now…yes, with Rei siding with the rebel army, it was no longer impossible.

For that reason, Mercurio would no longer accept a stalemate, even if Frizione were to join his side.

That was why Mercurio’s condition was for Frizione to serve under him.

「…Your Highness Frizione…」

Angela called out to her master with a worried look on her face.

Frizione continued to look at the letter several times with sadness in her eyes.

「Mercurio…I can’t believe you had those kind of thoughts too.」

Sadness seeped into her voice, knowing that no matter what she did, she wouldn’t be able to stop the bloody battle between the brothers.

「So, what do you want to do?」

Even as she asked, Angela had guessed Frizione’s answer.

Frizione’s thinking was naive, or more accurately, Mercurio’s might have been too harsh, but still, she had already made preparations to join up with the rebel army.

She had already explained this to the nobles who were part of her faction and they were all ready to either go with Frizione or evacuating to their own territory.

As that was the case, she couldn’t just decide not to join with the rebels anymore.

(Besides…)

As the image of her brothers flashed through her mind, Frizione spoke.

「No change. Let us join with the rebel army.」

「Is that really okay? Prince Mercurio has already decided on a decisive battle. Things aren’t going the way Your Highness planned.」

Angela asked for confirmation and Frizione nodded with sadness in her eyes.

「Yes. Since things have come to this, we need to put an end to the civil war as quickly as possible to reduce the hatred that has built up between us. Besides…Mercurio and Vihera, unlike Kabajid and Shurus, are probably still willing to listen to me.」

If a fight was unavoidable, they had to end it as soon as possible.

Not only Angela, even Widele’s eyes widened at the determination and sadness in Frizione’s eyes.

They had misjudged her. That was what they though about Frizione.

They had expected Frizione to feel lost and sad enough to not take any action. They had even anticipated that eventuality.

However, despite her sadness, Frizione immediately racked her brains for her next move.

(Indeed, she is a descendant of Emperor Tragist. I never thought I’d realise that at a time like this. It seems that Princess Frizione’s goal isn’t to survive the battle for the throne, but to end the fight between brothers as soon as possible.)

Angela spoke while secretly impressed.

「So, what are you going to do? I heard that Rei-sama has already been shown to the cabin Your Highness usually uses, so we can go right away…」

「No, please wait a bit. It will take some time to inform the members of my faction, so leave it as it is for now.」

「However, if the decision has been made, wouldn’t it be better to inform him as soon as possible? Rei-sama will feel more at ease if he knows.」

「…Widele, you met Kabajid near the castle. Is that right?」

「Eh? Ah, yes. That is, sorry for the trouble…」

Even though Dune was the one who had dragged them into it, the situation had still been incredibly tense with the bomb that was Rei. Furthermore, a Royal Knight had appeared.

If Kabajid hadn’t appeared, they really might have been interrogated by the Royal Knight.

If that had happened, Rei’s identity would definitely have been discovered.

That could have resulted in the Imperial Capital itself being burned down.

Widele, who didn’t know that Rei needed Set’s power to create the fire tornado, felt a chill run down her spine.

「If Kabajid saw Rei-sama, he probably knows his true identity. He must have seen him in the fighting tournament after all.」

「But, I heard that Rei-sama’s robes have a concealing effect…」

Widele recalled the information she had heard from Rei on their way to the Imperial Capital, but Frizione replied with a serious expression.

Frizione always had a gentle expression on her face, so her serious expression made her apear even more imposing than usual.

「Listen, Widele. Don’t underestimate Kabajid. He can read a person’s moves five or six steps ahead, so he’s probably seen through Rei-sama’s true identity. You have to assume that.」

「…Then, shouldn’t we hurry even more?」

If Rei’s true identity had been discovered, then the White Rose Knights, who had brought Rei here, to be under suspicion…and Frizione, who controlled the White Rose Knights, to also be under suspicion.

「From here on out, even the slightest mistake will not be tolerated. Those are the conditions we are now working under.」

It was already almost a certainty to Frizione that Kabajid knew who Rei was.

And, from Widele’s account of Rei’s personality and behaviour, she could sense that he hated being tied down by others, so if they were to tell Rei the details of their current situation, he might do something strange.

「Personally, I like him…but…」

Angela and Widele looked surprised at Frizione’s words.

Frizione was someone who generally didn’t dislike people, but even so, she rarely expressed her affinity for someone else…especially a man.

They hadn’t met in person, so they thought, or hoped, that Frizione didn’t have romantic feelings, but considering Vihera’s feelings for Rei, it might not be entirely impossible. Such thoughts crossed Angela and Widele’s minds.

「This, Princess Frizione. Just so you know, Princess Vihera also has feelings for Rei-sama…」

「Eh? Oh, that? Don’t get the wrong idea. I don’t have any romantic feelings for Rei. However, he is someone Vihera likes, right? If so, he’s someone who might become my brother-in-law in the future. I just thought it would be nice if we could get along.」

Frizione denied it with a wry smile, but being raised as a young lady, a princess, she was more interested in romance than most people.

Although her older and younger brothers were still young, there were hardly any rumours about them.

No, well, in Shurus’ case, he had a foster sibling of sorts called Amare, but even in Frizione’s eyes, there didn’t seem to be anything going on between them.

Frizione shook her head lightly as she thought about it.

「There are many things I would like to talk about right now, but it is not the time for that. …Angela, I’m sorry, but Rei-sama…no, since he is Vihera’s love interest and future brother-in-law, I think I should just call him Rei. Could you please bring Rei some food? I’d like you to talk to him while you’re there as well to see what kind of personality he has.」

「I don’t mind. I’m also interested after hearing about him from Widele.」

「…Angela, I shouldn’t need to say this, but you shouldn’t fall in love with Rei either. Rei has Vihera, my sister.」

Could it be considered fortunate or unfortunate that Widele didn’t know about Elena at this point in time?

Angela, who was told off by Frizione, sighed as she spoke.

「Unlike Your Highness, I’m not interested in love.」

「That is a problem in of itself. Especially for your father, Count Luxinois.」

Angela was the daughter of Count Luxinois.

However, since her brother would inherit the title of Count Luxinois, there was no need for her to take a husband.

To begin with, Angela was the second daughter…although her older sister had already married another noble.

「If I fall in love or get married, that will happen after I pass the position of Knight Commander to another person. Right now, my work is my love.」

Angela muttered as she glanced briefly in Widele’s direction.

Widele was a skilled member of the White Rose Knights and was well trusted by her subordinates.

She was a bit stubborn, but had what it took to be the next Knight Commander.

Of course, that didn’t mean that there weren’t others under consideration as a candidate for the next Knight Commander.

Although Widele was a strong contender, she was just still another candidate.

「Seriously…well, I can trust you, Angela, because that’s the kind of person you are. Anyway, please bring some food to Rei. And please keep an eye on your surroundings as you do that.」

「Yes.」

The slightly peaceful atmosphere from a few seconds ago changed completely and Angela bowed with a serious expression at Frizione’s words.

That said, she still appeared elegant, which was probably why she was the leader of the White Rose Knights.

「Then, Princess Frizione. I will immediately deliver food to Rei-sama. I will be away for a while. Widele, you will be guarding Princess Frizione until I return.」

「Yes. I accept the role of guard.」

Hearing Widele’s reply, Angela nodded with satisfaction before leaving.

Seeing her leave, Frizione immediately called someone from the White Rose Knights to convey a meeting request to the nobles in her faction.

She could have sent a letter, but a letter would be clear evidence if ever found.

If it were to fall into the hands of Shurus or Kabajid, it would undoubtedly be fatal for those in the First Princess’ faction.

Considering the danger, the best course of action was to send someone from White Rose Knights who had a certain level of skill.

(How far can I go? …But still, I don’t want to see the sight of brothers shedding blood. I guess I’m just selfish thinking that.)

She was known by the people for her kindness, but it was ultimately all just for her own selfish reasons.

Thinking about that, Frizione gave a faint smile of self mockery.

**A Demon Lord’s Tale Dungeons, Monster Girls, and Heartwarming Bliss - Chapter 572 - Resume Sightseeing (1)**

There were many things that I didn’t understand and many things I wanted to think about, but… We were able to find Shii and Sakuya without incident, and met up with the others who had stayed behind.

Our family members were in one of the nearby restaurants, but since they had not ordered any food, we decided to have lunch with them.

The people who seemed most relieved that Shii and Sakuya were safe were the captain and other members of the Erlin Federation. Our Shii and… No, I would like to apologize for our Sakuya.

The captain was not happy to interrupt the family gathering, so he took the liberty of leaving again. The guards also returned to protect us from a slight distance. So, it was just my family alone now.

“At any rate, I’m glad you two are safe!” (Nell)

Nell said, seeing Shii and Sakuya.

“I apologize for putting you all in worry! I’m also a little depressed about it…” (Shii)

Shii, who seemed to have finally gotten her emotions straightened out after crying so hard, was hungry and apologized as she munched on the fries that had been brought in for her.

It’s already past noon. Normally, she would have finished eating by now.

“If you’re feeling adventurous… It can’t be helped!” (Illuna)

“…Hmm. But you worried us. Next time, tell me about it, and I’ll take you on an adventure with us.” (Enne)

Hearing the exchange between the little girls, Nell looked at me.

“…What?” (Yuki)

“I just thought I’ve heard that saying a lot from someone.” (Nell)

I had an idea of what she was talking about, so I cleared my throat, and then, as if to cover my mistake, I tried to regain my composure and said to the others.

“Well, now that we’re all here, let’s do some sightseeing after dinner. I’ve heard all the sightseeing spots in the capital from the captain! But first, let’s take down this steak to replenish our energy.” (Yuki)

“No objection! I swear to you that I will not back down from my fight against the steak!” (Illuna)

“…Likewise. This pile of steaks is really worth fighting for. As a sword that has seen many battles, it makes my blood boil.” (Enne)

Illuna and Enne were understandably excited when they saw the pile of steaks on the platter that had been brought to them.

This restaurant was also recommended to us by the captain because it was a family-friendly restaurant.

My family usually ate hot pot together, and side dishes were served on a platter besides the pot with each of us taking a piece of ingredients on the pot and eating it, but such a culture of eating together by picking stuff in one platter was not often seen outside of Japan.

Even in my previous life, there were not many countries outside of Asia that ate this way.

So it was actually rare to find a place that served food on a platter like this.

Moreover, this place looked like a high-class restaurant from the outside. I could understand if it were a mass diner, but I wonder how many other places serve food like this. And the staff was also very accommodating.

Let me tell you how to tell whether a place was top-notch or not when you walked in.

It was a place where staff, even after seeing Shii and Wraith Girls, who were clearly not human, did not even react!

“Shii would rather eat vegetables than meat any day of the week! This vegetable is full of flavor! Maybe Rei, Rui and Ro can eat this too!” (Shii)

“Well, good for you, Shii… Illuna and Enne, you two should definitely eat your vegetables.” (Lefi)

“Well, you don’t eat many vegetables either… I was going to say that, but lately, you’ve been eating a lot of them.” (Yuki)

“Kaka, I am a parent too. If I don’t eat them, Riou and Sakuya won’t eat. Personally, I still don’t feel the need to eat grass.” (Lefi)

“Stop saying grass. You’re a super creature, you have no problem with an unbalanced diet. We are ordinary people who need to eat a well-balanced diet.” (Yuki)

“I don’t know if I can put Husband in the same category as ordinary people, but I agree with you. If you don’t eat vegetables, your skin will get rough.” (Lyuu)

“Shii doesn’t have a big belly, but she loves vegetables!” (Shii)

Shii was surprisingly fond of vegetables, while Enne neither liked nor disliked them. Shii liked potato salad and fried burdock root, and often asked Layla to make it for her.

Illuna disliked tomatoes and green peppers, which were the most common vegetables that children dislike, so there was no doubt that she did not have a good image of vegetables in general.

Recently, she started to eat them little by little, but it did not mean that she had conquered them, she was just putting up with them. I admire her spirit.

I could eat lettuce, cabbage, broccoli… But I wonder what was the difference between them.

Lefi was the only one who didn’t eat vegetables until now. Unlike us, she didn’t get sick or have rough skin even if she ate many sweets. In the first place, as a super creature, she didn’t need to eat as long as there was magic power.

Even if she continued to eat cake for three meals for a hundred years, she probably wouldn’t have any problems. She would most likely get bored before long.

Once again, I think that the creatures that reign near the top of this world were all out of the ordinary in many ways. Or perhaps the power of magic may be universal.

It had been several years since I started spending time with Lefi, and I have yet to see her get sick – well, there were those days when she was pregnant, but she had never even caught a cold.

After she got pregnant, she started cutting back on sweets and started eating three well-balanced meals, and now she was eating well so that her child wouldn’t hate vegetables. Great.

“Mumumu… I, I’m not a little kid anymore, I should eat vegetables too… To reduce Riou and Sakuya’s likes and dislikes, it’s better if I don’t show them that I have so many likes and dislikes!” (Illuna)

“…If Enne and the others say that something doesn’t taste good, Riou and Sakuya may also think it doesn’t taste good. Well, there are only a few dishes in our house that are not tasty.” (Enne)

“Eating is a blessing!” (Shii)

“That’s great, all three of you. But if you really don’t like something, you don’t have to force yourself to eat it. There are some dishes that you just don’t enjoy.” (Lefi)

“Oh, I know. I can’t handle eating bugs. I had to eat some dish made of bugs once before when I was working at the Rogard Empire. It was hard for me at that time.” (Yuki)

There was a time when I had to eat a certain dish, but because I was acting as a dignified demon emperor, I could not refuse to eat it, even if I disliked it.

It tasted like sour meat and was not inedible, but the visual was just too much.

Surprisingly, many high-end foodstuffs tend to be grotesque…

“Yes, but you eat shrimp, don’t you, husband? Or octopus or squid. I thought you liked grotesques.” (Nell)

“No, those are not weird foods… Oh, I see, if you don’t have a culture to eat them, they would indeed be included in the ‘weird’ category. Well, I mean, if you haven’t been exposed to something daily for a long time, you wouldn’t consider it food. So if adults don’t eat it, kids won’t eat it either.” (Yuki)

“When it comes to culture. I’m sure the elves, whose diet is based on the bounty of the forest, would look at this table full of meat and think, ‘Oh, my…’. That’s the hard part of cross-cultural exchange.” (Nell)

“That being said, I must thank Layla from the bottom of my heart for the daily planning of delicious meals for each of us in the family, where almost no one is from the same tribe. Thanks again Layla, I love you!” (Yuki)

“…Oh, oh my.”

“Layla’s rare blush! This should be photographed and kept as a family heirloom for generations to come!” (Nell)

“To control food means to control life… Layla has become the boss of our family!” (Lyuu)

“Lyuu, Nell, I’ll make you three meals of kelp when I get home!” (Layla)

“Oh, I’m just kidding, Layla! You looked so cute that I couldn’t help but let my true feelings out!” (Nell)

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, please forgive me! I love you too, Layla!” (Lyuu)

“Well, Lyuu will definitely be on a kelp diet…” (Layla)

“Why?” (Lyuu)

We laughed and enjoyed a little late lunch.

# **Jujutsushi Wa Yuusha Narenai**

**Chapter 240: The Chosen Trio**

Yamata no Orochi had been subjugated.

The final skill I used, 『The Death Herald Fairy Butterfly』, would not be an exaggeration if termed as an instant death curse that broke the core in half upon touch.

Instant death sounds like cheat power, but since I needed 『Droplet of Life』 to use that, it wasn’t the kind of skill that could be used on the go. It couldn’t be counted as a trump card unless I had 『Droplet of Life』 in hand.

Anyway, now that I’d defeated Yamata no Orochi, the magic circle leading to the next area should appear soon.

After Yamata no Orochi had been defeated, most of its big frame vanished just like when its head decapitated.

Some of its bones, scales, and shell remained.

Naturally, it was precious raid boss material that should be collected, but the booty aside, the transfer magic circle was more important.

「So, it really is appearing in this place just like the normal boss.」

「Yeah, something like that.」

When the huge frame of Yamata no Orochi vanished, the rocky mountain was left with a huge hollow inside. The caves used by the eight heads to come out became tunnels to enter the interior of the rocky mountain.

Nevertheless, since the rocky mountain had already been split in half, I could see the sky just by raising my face.

The space that housed Orochi, the familiar stone wall and floor, were mostly crumbled, but it still maintained its original form.

In the center of that open space was the familiar stone room like I’d seen before where the transfer magic circle was waiting for us.

「What do you think Takanashi-san, can we use this transfer magic circle?」

「We can activate it properly since it reacted to the core.」

「Thank goodness. I was afraid for once that the transfer magic circle might be damaged.」

Takanashi laughed while glancing at Yuuma.

「Let’s gather the materials and head back to the school tower.」

「Are you sure that we’re not to use transfer immediately?」

「Eh, you want to transfer immediately in our current condition, are you insane, Souma-kun?」

We just finished a long and tough battle.

Though no one died, Ueda and Nakai had to receive immediate treatment.

「I mean, we can use the fairy plaza at the teleported destination to rest.」

Surely, up until now, we had been actually using the transfer magic circle as soon as we defeated the boss… But how much good materials had been piled up inside the school tower?

「We won’t use the transfer magic circle until we’re fully prepared because no one can guarantee that we can procure food in the next area.」

「Makes sense.」

「And Mei-chan returned ahead of us to prepare for victory celebration.」

「You actually made Futaba-san cook after such fierce battle.」

「Even I, the MVP of this battle for finishing off Orochi, can’t rest on my lapel and have to check the teleportation circle and gathering materials.」

「Got it, sorry for the question. Do as you like.」

Souma-kun,  who always found faults with me, could only heave a deep sigh this time.

「Though I don’t think that Yamata no Orochi was going to pop again, let’s leave a watcher, just in case.」

「Got it, we will depart to the next area right after we finish our preparation.」

---

Victory celebration would be held the next day.

Since Mei-chan was preparing it in high spirits, it wouldn’t be ready tonight.

By the time all of us gathered Orochi’s material and returned to the school tower, the sun had already set.

Since everyone was clearly exhausted after such a long and tough battle― I decided to talk to everyone after dinner.

「Thank you for today’s hard work. I know that everyone is itching to hit the bed right away, but I’ve something important to tell everyone.」

I announced at the start of the class meeting that hadn’t been held for quite a while.

Since even Tendou-kun didn’t ditch the meeting just because he was sleepy, everyone else found no reason to ditch the meeting either.

Since I didn’t want to waste time, I went straight to the main topic.

「This is the matter regarding the 『Heavenly Gate』 to get out of this dungeon. My opinion about the three person quota.」

「Momokawa, that’s―」

In a certain way, that was an untouchable topic. Everyone avoided this topic during our cohabitation life in the school tower.

Everyone knew that a conflict was bound to happen when someone touched this topic.

But we had no choice but to face this problem sooner or later.

This problem called the 3-person-quota was akin to a ticking time bomb that was bound to explode the closer we were to the deepest part of this dungeon. If I could slip into this at the very last moment, I could get out of this dungeon safely.

At the same time, I am bound to think that someone might backstab me.

I mean, I was the first on the list of someone who might betray others at first chance in the hand.

「Momokawa-kun, we decided to leave with everyone.」

「Y-Yes! That topic… Will cause internal conflict…」

「Calm down. I made this suggestion on the basis that everyone can escape together using 3-person-quota rule.」

Everyone murmured for a while, and I waited until they had all calmed down.

If it’s now, after we subjugated Yamata no Orochi, everyone would most likely agree with my plan. Man, my plan wasn’t smooth sailing, but everything went smoothly since Yamata no Orochi was defeated.

That’s why now was the most suitable time to speak.

「Okay, let’s hear it, Momokawa.」

「Yes, let’s hear Momokawa-kun first and make decision later.」

Everyone finally calmed down after Souma-kun and Class Rep said so.

Yup, I endured for a whole five minutes until everyone calmed down.

「As I’ve said before, our goal to escape together from this dungeon doesn’t change. The preliminary plan is to grope around to find a way to allow everyone to escape together.」

Well, that was yet to be decided. I think Souma-kun had something along that way.

Even if I was wrong, I did think that we had to find a way that allowed everyone to leave this dungeon.

「But let’s not close the possibility that there’s plenty enough chance that we might not be able to escape this dungeon at all.」

Rather, that looked like the biggest possibility.

Albeit, under the condition of 3-people quota rule.

If that were really the case, those who presented the rule would definitely limit the escape quota to three people.

And those who manage this dungeon would change the degree of difficulty of this dungeon to ensure that the 3-person quota was fulfilled.

Maybe we could tinker with that 3-person quota.

But even if that was possible, only the 『Sage』 Takanashi could do something like that. Sorry, but I refuse to put everyone’s fate, including mine, at that girl’s mercy.

「That’s why I want to make an escape plan to escape from this dungeon by foot.」

After cohabitating in this School Tower, I could say that we wouldn’t have a problem with living a normal life after we get out of this dungeon.

In fact, we had already gathered enough ingredients to the point that we wouldn’t have a problem with food for a while. We had change of clothes too, and weapon upgrade as long as we had the materials.

As long as we didn’t get stranded on a wasteland where not even a blade of grass grew, we would have no problem.

「Since almost all of us travelled the dungeon by foot, we won’t have a problem walking until we arrive at the human settlement. On the other hand, let’s have the three people guaranteed to escape to Astria Kingdom find us.」

It was explained clearly in the notification mail that we received in the beginning.

The announcement about teleportation magic is called the 『Heavenly Gate』 located in the deepest part of the dungeon.

And the destination of that teleportation circle was the temple in Sigrun, the royal capital of Atria Kingdom.

Since it was called the royal capital of the kingdom, it was definitely not a deserted place. My guess was it was a prosperous kingdom of humans.

And it had the technology to send messages to us right after we arrived in this dungeon.

According to what we learned up until now, considering the magic ability of those with spellcaster vocation, it was a special ability that required advanced magical technology. And there was no way such advanced technology would have medieval-level civilization. Rather, I wouldn’t be surprised if their magic civilization triumphed over the modern earth.

In short, with the assumption that Astria Kingdom owned a really advanced magic civilization, there were plenty of possibilities that they had a way to find our whereabouts without us realizing it.

「Under the assumption that this other world was the same size as the earth, it should be possible to get the estimation of our current position based on the environment and star.」

I mean, the jungle tower had the outdoor theme complete with a starry night spectacle.

In short, it could be limited based on the climate of the region, and humidity.

Because there was coniferous forest, we could scratch the region with a cold climate.

On top of that, the estimation of our current position should be revealed based on the latitude of the stars.

「Oo~h, that’s brilliant, Momokawa.」

Thank you Randou-san. Though it didn’t feel like praise when she was the one to say it.

「That’s why before the departure, we should gather as many items as possible that could become a marker for the position of this dungeon.」

For example, plants unique to the region around the dungeon, or flowers that only grow in the region where the dungeon is located could be used to pinpoint the location of this dungeon.

「Gomas can be found all over the place, and wyvern is flying in the air. The thunder-breathing T-Rex, Roirops, Jaja that live in special regions can become a clue.」

Anyway, the first objective was to gather as much information as possible about the area around the dungeon.

Specific clues such as vegetation, monsters living in that region, or historic ruins could become important markers. There was a possibility that the architectural style of this stone building seemed to be unique to this place.

Fortunately, our cutting-edge technology called smartphones has already been restored.

We could take as many pictures as possible that could become clues until the memory of our smartphone filled up to the brim.

「Once the specific coordinate of this dungeon has been located, the rest is only sending rescue party.」

「I see… Surely, if we expect rescue to come from outside, walking by foot isn’t impossible.」

「Yes. Much better than walking without any particular direction.」

My classmates gave a positive reaction.

Everybody’s attitude changed 180 after I explained that we form a three-person team under the assumption to aid everyone to escape.

「So, who’s this trio that you’re going to send out?」

「You’ll be in trouble if you don’t choose properly~」

「Bad politicians gain a lot of resentment you kno~w?」

JuryMary were right. The three people selected by me were important.

「I choose these three since I see them as the most optimum choice. And I’ll tell you my reason and get your opinion.」

「… So who is it?」

Souma-kun asked with a resolute face. Everyone waited with bated breath for my announcement.

「The first person is Tendou-kun.」

Yup, no one raised a ruckus.

No one dared to look at Tendou-kun or said 「Unfa~ir!」.

「The biggest reason I choose Tendou-kun is his combat prowess. There is no guarantee that Astria Kingdom is safe.」

It wasn’t just in the dungeon, we had to constantly raise our vigilance even around the human society that we were unfamiliar with.

Bad guys are everywhere. No matter how high your aspirations are, you’re finished as soon as a third party aims at your back.

Not to mention that we had never met people from this world yet. Even if they’re the same humans, rather it’s because they’re the same humans as us, we had to raise our vigilance as much as possible. We shouldn’t expect good public order like in Japan either.

「Surely, there’s no need to doubt Ryuuichi’s combat prowess.」

「Are you sure, Momokawa? You know that I’m a delinquent, right? There’s no guarantee that I’ll behave myself in that whatever kingdom.」

「I know that I can trust you in this regard, Tendou-kun. If it’s you, I know that you won’t hestitate to do anything and everything to save your friend.」

Putting it in a positive way, it was the bond between friends.

Negatively, it was hostage.

「Tch, Momokawaaa…」

「Please don’t glare at me like that. I mean, you also know that you’ll be fine even if you are sent alone out of this dungeon right?」

Tendou-kun was glaring at me since he realized that I used his friendship with Souma-kun to choose him, but since I was serious about this given his capabilities and personality, I wouldn’t back down on this matter.

「Humph, fine then. So who’s the second person? Knowing you, I can pretty much guess who the second person is.」

「As expected of Tendou-kun, you read me like open book.」

「It’s Sakura right?」

Correct.

「Eh, why me though!?」

「Yes, the second person is Sakura-chan.」

Seeing her reaction, it seemed she had never expected that she would be chosen.

This was the best chance for me to legally expel undesirable personnel. Like hell I’m going to miss the biggest chance to exile you, the biggest problem child of class 2-7.

「Just like Tendou-kun, Sakura-chan would have a reason to do her best to find our location.」

I wasn’t lying.

In the first place, aside from her being a 『Saint』Sakura-chan was blessed with beauty and brains.

I mean, even back when we were in japan, I was constantly raising my vigilance against her since she seemed to hate me for reasons that I couldn’t understand.

Thanks to her high-specs, and the fact that she had to rescue her beloved big brother, Souma Yuuto, she would have enough motivation to save us.

The thing needed for the three people who escaped was the motivation to save us even after they escaped to safety.

Saying that they’re going to save us was easy, but maintaining that motivation was the biggest challenge. And it began with getting accustomed to living outside of the dungeon, in a place called Astria Kingdom.

Unpredictable trouble and difficulties occured repeatedly.

Thus, we needed someone who could maintain their motivation amidst all of those difficulties to save us.

In this regard, Tendou-kun had his pride, Sakura-chan had her love, that’s why they would try their best to find Souma-kun for sure.

The only other people with this kind of motivation were Mei-chan and me.

But Mei-chan didn’t want to leave me behind,nor would I let her go.

「But, I…」

「Accept this role, Sakura.」

「Nii-san!!」

「Everyone might think this is unfair… But personally, I feel at ease.」

**I Became the Strongest With The Failure Frame【Abnormal State Skill】As I Devastated Everything**

**401 - Warriors**

As Gio spoke, he moved his black-bladed katana.

With force, in a diagonal slash.

Ars retreated from the spot.

Even while he retreats though, Gio’s blade that had bitten into him tore through his flesh.

His chest split open from the heart to the left side, blood spilling out.

At the same time, Ars launched a counterattack at Gio during his retreat.

Parrying it with his other katana, Gio leaped toward me.

[So, it’s you.]

[Seems you’re still in one piece.]

Even as he responded to me, Gio’s gaze was fixed on Ars’s equipment.

The gear belonged to Armia, his comrade also belonging to the Faraway Country.

[As stated in the information beforehand, communication through dialogue with this Divine Servant seems difficult. Therefore… her safety isn’t something I’m not certain about.]

At my words, Gio just responded curtly.

[—I see.]

The twin-bladed swordsman, crouched like a black leopard, seemed calm.

But I could tell.

He was suppressing a raging fury deep within him.

At the same time— he understood it.

Losing his composure against this opponent could lead to certain death.

(I’d heard he could be hotheaded, yet strangely composed at times… I see now— he’s not just a reckless man. And…)

I recalled Touka’s words:

“If you exclude Seras, Sogou, and the Takao Sisters, next in line would be Gio and the Mad Beauty Emperor.”

(Even Touka acknowledged him as one of the skilled warriors…)

[Perhaps it’s fortunate that I’ve met up with you here.]

[Same here.]

Gio replied, continuing to observe Ars.

[I can’t let someone who survived the outside world die in a place like this. That’s why I picked a position close to yours.]

I let out a soft laugh.

Then, I shared the information I had gathered about Ars with Gio.

Ars— had already begun regenerating.

The blood he had spilled seemed to flow back into his white body.

The torn flesh had also closed up.

[The heart isn’t the “core” then.]

Gio noted with a keen eye.

(As expected, he notices everything…)

I had noticed it too.

When Gio attacked, Ars had instinctively protected certain areas—

(It seemed like he prioritized defending his neck and torso with his shield and blade whip…)

This likely meant that one of those areas could be Ars’ critical weak point.

[So, what should we do, black leopard twin swordsman? Should we retreat from here and try to regroup with the others?]

Gio stood up from his crouched stance.

He adjusted his grip on his katana, careful not to apply too much force.

[That depends on whether that guy would even let us escape.]

(Fumu… He’s level-headed enough to consider retreat as an option…)

“However…” Gio continued.

[Still, I’d rather avoid making the mistake of focusing too much on retreating and getting killed because of it.]

[Umu.]

Sometimes, attack is the best form of defense.

By engaging in combat, one can minimize the opportunities for the enemy to exploit.

Sometimes, taking on a fight could even save lives, allowing time to wait for allies.

[Besides—]

Gio glanced at his hand.

[From what I felt… He didn’t seem like something completely out of our league.]

I shifted my stance, keeping my eyes on Ars.

[—Shall we?]

With a slight shift in his katana’s angle, Gio replied,

[…Let’s give it a shot.]

Fighting might create an opportunity to retreat.

Or perhaps, valuable information could be gained through combat.

It could even become useful information that can be passed on to others.

After exchanging glances, Gio and I returned our focus to Ars.

His aura— had changed.

(Fumu… Choosing to fight might have been the right decision after all.)

It felt as if Ars’ killing intent had slightly diminished the moment we adopted a combative stance.

Had we tried to flee, he might have pursued us relentlessly with the sole intent of killing.

However, the moment we showed the intent to fight—

His atmosphere shifted, Ars seemingly intent to “enjoy” this battle.

(Is this person seeking conflict itself? The air of disappointment vanished, and at the same time, the intent to kill diminished…)

In other words.

Does disappointment turn into a willingness to kill without question?

Ars opened his arms and assumed a stance.

The blade-whips on his shoulders danced.

[ ” Becoming stronger is fun… What’s wrong with that? Vysis… You sure don’t understand anything. ” ]

Ars charged forward.

Me and Gio stepped forward, splitting to the sides.

Gio went to Ars’ right, faced with his sword.

Meanwhile, I went to Ars’s left, faced with his shield.

The whip blades were swung toward both sides.

Both of us dealt with the whip blades using our katanas.

(The trajectory of the whip blades is, for now, easier to read but—)

Gio skillfully dealt with both Ars’ whip blades and his sword using his katana.

As for me, I continued the offensive and defensive movements, carefully looking for an opening.

If she were to be recognized as just support, having such a role would lose its meaning.

The support role is alive only when they make the opponent a true attack come from them.

Back in the time I was a Blood Champion.

In the early days, we fought in groups.

The feeling I had from that time suddenly resurfaced.

Those were quite nostalgic times.

Now that I think about it, we did something like this back then.

At that moment…

[ ! ]

A flash.

Gio’s strike cleaved through Ars’ shoulder, armor and all.

The whip blade, along with the flesh from his shoulder, was sent flying through the air.

[ ” Guwaaaaahhhh—!? ” ]

(I see, an attack aimed at reducing the number of blade whips huh.)

At first glance, that figure of Ars appears to be someone wearing full-body armor.

However, in reality, it seems that “all that was Ars”.

Gio detached the blade whip from Ars, along with his armored flesh.

(Mhmm?)

…Ksssht…

The severed flesh is trying to return to Ars.

It moves autonomously.

As if the flesh itself has a will and is moving on its own.

The shed red blood did the same.

They’re moving like a living creature.

In the midst of the offensive and defensive exchange, Gio was about crush the separated flesh—

[—]

But Gio instantly stopped his foot.

The whip blade, which had been hanging limply, was moving.

Had he stepped on it, his foot would have been exposed to the attack of the whip blade that remained in the flesh.

Glaring at the enemy, Gio spoke.

[He can control even the severed parts of your body huh.]

(As expected, unless the “core” part is destroyed, it will continue to regenerate…?)

The sound of the katana’s strike.

That sound brought with it the noise of flesh being severed.

Gio’s blade cut through Ars’ arm.

However— he didn’t sever it completely.

It seems he was attempting to cut off the arm this time.

[ ” Hahh… Hahh… Blood… Kuh… S- So strong— this guy, he’s strong…!! But I won’t lose… Like I would lose… HAAAAAHHHHH!!! ” ]

His words and voice carried a fierce spirit.

However, the shout echoing from the void still felt somewhat “disjointed”.

I exchanged glances with Gio again.

(What a formidable man. Just through a glance, he can convey his next move… A warrior capable of such natural, near-perfect coordination, I’ve never encountered someone like him in the past.)

It’s not just his combat skills.

His tall stature, firm muscles.

His combat-ready bone structure.

And above all— his long limbs, and flexibility.

These are important factors in battle.

Especially height, bone structure, and limb length— they can be considered innate “talents”.

(He’s fighting on equal footing with that large Divine Servant… or even better. His physical advantages must play a huge role.)

I’m inferior to him in all of those aspects.

(But—)

Speed.

Reflexes.

Instinctive predictions based on experience.

That is something I take pride in.

The clash of sparks continued.

In the midst of such a clash— I suddenly felt a sense of unease.

(—What’s this? This Divine Servant… something’s off…)

However, I couldn’t quite pinpoint what it was.

Gio was pushing forward.

It seemed like he was winning in terms of power and technique.

The way he is now makes him seem like a storm of black blades.

Even the flesh fragments on the ground, autonomously writhing and swinging their whip blades, were being dealt with.

(Gio certainly seemed to be at an advantage… but he hasn’t delivered the finishing blow yet… As expected, to decide it, it has to be a strike to the neck or torso. Ars is clearly wary of those two spots… —Hmm?)

[ ” D*mn it… Shion… Even though I have to defeat the Root of All Evil and save the world— it’s just so fun… fighting is so fun! The exchange of life is fun! I’m enjoying it! Kuh… What should I do? I— as someone summoned to save this world… is this the right thing to do? Is feeling like this wrong? Answer me… Shion… Hey, Shion… say something… ” ]

Ars is speaking.

Could these be the same words he spoke back when he was fighting against that time’s Root of All Evil?

From the context, it’s clear that he was once a Hero from Another World.

[—Tch, what a creepy bastard… just listening to his words, it doesn’t even feel like we’re “fighting”…]

Although Gio had inflicted numerous injuries on Ars, the battle was still in a stalemate.

(Yes… A stalemate but…)

Stalemate.

(…A stalemate huh.)

Thinking about such a thing, I couldn’t help feeling second thoughts.

Should we maintain this stalemate and wait for reinforcements to arrive?

But looking at it the other way, there could be enemy reinforcements as well.

(If only Touka and Hijiri were here, they might be able to find a way to victory…)

Even so, I searched for a ray of hope in my own way.

At that moment…

[ ! ]

Two more whip blades grew from Ars.

These two blades sprouted from his elbows.

Even so, Gio continued to press on, unconcerned with the new development.

I also continued the fight.

(Fumu… If it’s just two more blades, both Gio and I can still handle it… and besides—)

I focused my eyes.

[…Gio! Could you pull back for a moment!?]

Without a word, Gio immediately jumped back.

I retreated in the opposite direction.

For a brief moment, Ars hesitated, unsure of what to do.

[—…I see.]

It seemed Gio understood as well.

Yes—

Though the number of whip blades had increased, their reach had slightly shortened.

Ars had been reluctant to increase the number of blades until now.

That’s probably because increasing the number reduces their range.

(And… with the increase in the number of blades, I felt their power slightly diminished. That’s probably why this Divine Servant couldn’t just increase their numbers as much as he wanted.)

Ars had not been able to fully defend against Gio’s fierce attacks until now.

It seems that he tried to counter by increasing his number of strikes.

In a way— this could be seen as him switching to a defensive approach.

[…Gio.]

[Ou.]

[While facing this guy, I’m strangely feeling like there’s something out of place.]

[Something’s out of place?]

[I don’t know what the cause is yet though… It’s possible I’m just guessing wrongly.]

Gio snorted.

[Intuition’s important. Especially… when it’s the intuition of a skilled warrior.]

(Fumu…)

A skilled warrior.

It seemed like Gio recognized me as one.

Gio skillfully twirled his katana in his hand and said.

[That out-of-place feeling you’ve got might be the key to figuring him out.]

[It’s just intuition without basis, I’m not sure it’s a good idea to take such a gamble.]

[No… it’s because we’re fighting this guy that it’s worth trying.]

With that, Gio leaned forward.

Taking a stance that resembled a beast, he was about to pounce on its prey.

[To grasp that out-of-place feeling— I’ll buy us a little more time.]

—Fwoosh!—

With a powerful push, Gio charged at Ars.

He immediately began launching a barrage of strikes.

I, in sync with Gio’s movement, closed in on Ars.

An even fiercer clash began.

Gio was holding his own against the Divine Servant.

I, while observing, continued to deflect Ars’ attacks.

—The battle raged on.

Perhaps thanks to them being designed especially for combating Deities.

Against non-Deities— against us— we can manage to fight.

We’re holding our ground.

(That said, we still can’t press the attack… I also can’t figure out the source of that out-of-place feeling… Maybe it really is just my imagination—)

[ ! ]

In an instant, Gio’s movements changed.

And I felt it.

He’s telling me to synchronize with him.

Gio severed Ars’s wrist, which resembled a gauntlet.

The severed wrist, still clutching Armia’s sword, tumbled to the ground.

Gio, twisting his body to evade the whip blades— pressed forward and slipped into Ars’s guard.

At the same time— I launched my own attack.

I deflected two whip blades and slammed a powerful kick into his shield.

The shield shook violently, and I could tell Ars gripped it even tighter.

Gio feigned a strike at Ars’ torso, then drove one of his katanas into Ars’ thigh.

[ ” Uooooooohhhhh—! ” ]

Ars roared in agony. Gio, unaffected by the sound, gripped the hilt of his remaining katana firmly with both hands.

— Creak —

I could sense the immense power building in his black hands.

Gio’s target was clear.

He’s— aiming to sever Ars’ torso.

[ ” Like hell I’ll let you do that—! ” ]

Ars roared again.

In that moment— my world went silent.

[—]

The sea of my thoughts, clearer and more transparent than ever.

That’s something I understood on an instinctive level.

Was it because my foresight had reached its peak?

Or perhaps, a beast’s intuition?

… Just now …

Gio’s words.

“I’ll buy us a little more time.”

“Buying time.”

This could be taken as a declaration of him taking up a defensive battle.

In other words, he was declaring we “aren’t aiming for victory”.

It strips Ars of the option to “fight for a decisive blow”.

However, whether Ars understood the intent of such words is uncertain.

I mean, whether he could even comprehend our words is still unknown.

However— strategic maneuvering as a warrior is possible.

This much was clear during our exchanges.

Likely, a form of “conversation” through clashing weapons could occur.

In this battle, Ars must have realized it.

I was not the primary attacker but the support.

And—

“I was striving with all effort to conceal that I’m playing support.”

Indeed, I was committed to that role.

I had been fighting with that intention.

No, perhaps— Gio also shared this.

However— Gio suddenly switched tactics.

I grasped his intent in less than an instant.

Our instincts resonated, creating an almost miraculous shared understanding.

Perhaps this only occurred because both were “exceptional warriors”—

(Regardless—)

Gio shifted his killing blow— meant to sever Ars’ torso— into bait.

And then, he signaled me to “do it”.

Ars’ defenses were already focused on protecting his torso.

Thus—

(With this one strike—)

[ ” You lot, not bad— ” ]

— Swoosh! —

My blade severed Ars’ head cleanly from his neck.

---

**402 - t r u e**

Before entering the labyrinth.

I, Eve Speed, had been watching those being teleported.

The Takao sisters, wearing their Fly Knight masks, stepped into the teleportation room.

After exchanging a word with them, I waited for my turn.

Then, Gio Shadowblade spoke to me.

[You can manipulate magic power, can’t you?]

[Umu.]

When I answered, Gio handed me two swords.

[Take these.]

Rather startled when the swords were almost thrust into my hands. I examined them.

[Katanas huh…They seem quite old.]

[They came from a Sealed Treasury in our Faraway Country. Apparently, they’re Ancient Magic Weapons. Just a little magic power makes them lighter and sharper.]

[You’re giving these to me?]

[I’ve got these.]

Gio motioned toward the two black sheathed swords strapped in a cross behind his waist.

[I don’t need four swords. Besides, your sword looks kinda fragile.]

[This sword of mine is not without its merits. But I’ll accept your gift gratefully.”

I drew the katana and tested its grip.

As I infused a slight amount of magic power into it, the blade glowed faintly.

After a few swings to familiarize myself with its feel, I returned it to its sheath.

[What fine weapons.]

[You figured it out after just a few swings? Well, I guess that reaction proves you’ve got the knack for it.]

[And your ability to tell that shows you’re no ordinary swordsman.]

Gio shifted the topic.

[This labyrinth entry… I heard only those ready to die were chosen for it.]

Volunteers from various nations.

Each one an elite, selected on the condition that they had accepted the possibility of death.

In other words— they’d consented to die.

Neither the Mad Emperor nor Touka seemed to have forced anyone.

At least, not as far as I knew.

Everyone volunteered, believing it was to save this world.

Some aimed to return to their original world.

And others— to put an end to their vendettas.

Ahead of me, the teleportation proceeded in order.

When my turn came, I began walking toward the entrance.

Gio joined me, walking at my side.

[However… I have no intention of dying. The most important woman in my life is about to give birth to my child. Until I see that kid’s face, there’s no way I’m dying. So even if I have to die, I won’t.]

[And yet, you’re still joining this battle.]

[Of course I am. I’m doing this to protect the future of my unborn child… and the woman who’s bringing them into this world.]

“You already knew that, didn’t you?”, Gio grumbled.

I smiled.

[I feel the same way.]

I turned to look at the familiar who was watching me from Nyaki’s shoulder.

[I’m not going to die.]

I said.

[We’re going to save our future.]

---

[—, …]

Landing on the ground, I felt a sharp pain.

A laceration ran across my left arm.

It must have been from the whip blade during the earlier attack.

(I thought I’d accounted for counterattacks… but to land that blow to sever the neck, this injury was unavoidable. No, rather than that…)

Gio’s left arm was split.

Not just cut off— it was split vertically.

Back when I lived among the Speed Clan, I once tried to snap a tree branch by pulling it apart with both hands. I couldn’t manage it, leaving it awkwardly split halfway.

That’s what his arm looked like— split awkwardly in two. Like the jaws of a crocodile, perhaps.

From the gap between his index and middle fingers down to just before his elbow, it was torn wide open.

It looked brutal.

During my days as a Blood Champion, I’d seen fighters lose their arms below the elbow to an opponent’s attack many times.

In those cases, it seemed there was a certain resignation that many could come to terms with.

But for those whose arms had split like Gio’s…

Perhaps it was the incomplete nature of the injury, but they seemed unable to make that mental leap.

I once saw a Blood Champion in that condition descend into panic, eventually wailing uncontrollably.

But then—

—Fwoosh!

[ ! ]

Without hesitation, Gio severed the split part of his left arm with the katana in his right hand.

And then—

[Can you… buy me just a little time?]

Clenching a cord between his teeth, Gio used it to tie off his arm near the base, stopping the bleeding.

My body— just as he’d asked, was already moving.

I deflected the incoming whip blade with my katana and slid in front of Gio as a shield.

After quickly finishing his makeshift first aid, Gio clicked his tongue.

[I was covering my leg, so I let my guard down on my arm… D*mn it, this Divine Servant’s speed and strength exceeded expectations. Maybe he was hiding his true power until now, and this sense of urgency brought it out.]

[…That might be the case.]

Ars’ severed head lay on the ground.

What’s more, it was split in two.

Right after severing the neck, I’d dealt another strike to the head.

I suspected the “core” might be inside.

However, the severed neck was still connected to the torso by thin threads of blood and fibrous bundles.

I saw the head slowly trying to return to its original position.

Ideally, I wanted to completely destroy that head.

But Ars’s body— now headless yet more menacing and with fewer openings, wouldn’t allow it.

[ ” Amazing, this is amazing… Human, monster, demon, it doesn’t matter. Fighting strong opponents makes me happy! I’ll defeat you all— and grow even stronger! ” ]

(Even severing the neck and splitting the head in two isn’t enough to stop him… Does that mean the true weak point is in the torso?)

Still—

If Ars’ speed and strength increased during Gio’s attack, then it was likely that Gio’s strike on the torso wouldn’t have gotten through anyway.

The deception created by that feint allowed my attack on the neck to succeed.

In that sense, the decision to take down the neck at that stage wasn’t wrong.

But— —that’s not the problem.

(If we can destroy what seems to be the remaining weak point, the torso— will we truly win?)

Doubt started to creep into my mind.

(Ars fights with a warrior’s “dialogue”… there’s an unspoken rhythm of a fighter within this battle. If that’s the case… even if the torso isn’t the core, wouldn’t it still protect it instinctively?)

If Ars was once a warrior, he would protect the weak points they had as a human.

A thrust toward the heart.

Decapitation.

Severing the torso.

All things a warrior’s instincts would dictate avoiding at any cost.

(Could it be… Ars is merely protecting “vital points” based on the instincts he had as a human warrior?)

If that’s the case, even if I were to sever the remaining torso, it might not destroy the “core”.

(No… there’s no guarantee this Divine Servant even has a true weak point, a so-called “core”…)

Perhaps having arrived at the same conclusion, Gio spoke.

[There’s a chance its regeneration has limits… If that’s true, we’d have to keep hitting it with fatal-level attacks nonstop…]

Narrowing his eyes, Gio stared at Ars with frustration etched on his face.

I could understand his feelings.

[ ” What’s the matter!? Come on! I stopped in this village because I wanted to fight you! Right now, I’m not the hero trying to save the world— I’m just the warrior, Ars! Not enough… I’m not done yet! You’re not saying that is it, right!? ” ]

Ars’ combat ability had undoubtedly improved since our first encounter.

Not only that— even his regeneration speed seemed faster.

The slashes and wounds we’d inflicted during the battle.

The severed head and the fragments of flesh cut from the shoulder area.

They were already starting to reattach.

[ ” Vysis… I may have grown too strong. But I still want to feel that razor-thin edge between life and death again… Like when I first became a hero… I want that thrilling battle. And— I want to fight and win against someone like that. ” ]

[…]

A strange unease lingered within me.

Unless I unraveled the source of this discomfort, I wouldn’t find a way to break through this battle.

That much I was certain of.

And that lingering unease within me—

From its nebulous outline, it was finally beginning to take the shape of something more concrete.

---

As a Blood Champion, as a warrior, what is crucial to survival is the ability to discern one’s opponent.

The power to read, observe— and gauge.

Back when I traveled with Seras Ashrain, we sparred together.

Even in that brief exchange, I quickly saw through her.

The latent talent she possessed, “the potential to go beyond”, though it had not yet fully bloomed.

And then, during my battle with Itsuki Takao in the Golden Demon Zone.

“The nature of growing stronger through combat.”

The reason I was able to swiftly grasp Itsuki’s unique trait during that short confrontation was my keen ability to assess an opponent’s nature.

I lack the broad foresight and deep consideration to predict the future, like Touka does.

That’s what I think of myself as Eve Speed.

However— when it comes to matters within the heat of battle…

I do think it’s okay to trust myself, at least to some extent.

---

“The Divine Servants are designed for Anti-Deity combat.”

“Which is why those who aren’t Deities should still be able to hold their own against them.”

This assumption might have clouded the path to the answer.

(That’s why I was able to fight reasonably well against them… or so I thought.)

But was that truly the case?

Ars possesses extraordinary talent as a warrior.

He is a warrior chosen by Vysis to become a Divine Servant.

With someone like Gio, it might make sense…

But for someone like me— could I really fight evenly against him one-on-one?

No.

Embarrassing as it is to admit— when I think about it carefully…

The fact that I could hold my own even briefly during our initial encounter feels… off.

Looking back now, I can’t shake that feeling.

Could it be that Ars, wanting to enjoy the fight, was holding back?

It’s possible.

But—

(That wasn’t the fighting style of someone holding back.)

In the Colosseum, I’ve seen countless warriors.

There’s a certain tell to them— a distinct air to the way someone fights when they’re holding back.

Ars had none of that.

(Of course, there’s the possibility he has Touka-level acting skills. But still—)

“I want to experience the thrill of life-or-death combat.”

That’s what Ars said.

(If I take Ars’s words thus far as true, then he… genuinely enjoys battles where life and death hang in the balance. And holding back— that would strip away the very thrill he craves…)

In other words…

For Ars, holding back is something “not fun”.

If he enjoys life-or-death battles, then the thrill lies in fighting at full strength and testing whether he can win— This delicate balance is what matters most to him.

It’s somewhat similar to the spectators who visit the Colosseum.

It’s only when warriors fight to the death with everything they have that it’s truly worth watching.

In any case— this means Ars is probably not holding back.

[—]

At that moment, I suddenly realized something.

The source of the discomfort— the tangled thread of uncertainty.

An image materialized in my mind.

(There’s only one way this could be possible. But if that’s the case… for anyone fighting Ars, it could be seen as a “trap”—)

[…Gio.]

[Did you figure it out?]

[Probably, but this Divine Servant…]

Ars is waiting now.

He’s waiting for our next move.

I spoke.

[Could it be that this Divine Servant has a tendency to match— or perhaps, just “slightly surpass”, the fighting abilities of his opponents?]

[—, …The heck is that supposed to mean?]

[Umu… I’m not fully sure of what I’m saying either. But, if I were to put it into words, that’s the best I can come up with.]

“I want to fight and win against someone like that.”

Ars himself said that.

The point is— he has no intention of giving up victory.

“Even in such a close fight, he wants to win.”

If that’s Ars’ desire, then the conclusion I’m coming to is the same as my earlier hypothesis.

And if I’m right, the issue with this trait is—

[So, you’re saying… the stronger the opponent, the stronger this Divine Servant becomes?]

[Umu… He’d just be a little stronger than the opponent.]

That is why—

I had been feeling like me winning against him might actually be possible.

Those fighting against Ars might think they’re keeping up with him in a close battle.

But in reality, Ars is simply “adjusting” his strength.

He’s lowering his combat ability just enough to make it seem like we’re in a death struggle.

And most likely, Ars is doing this unconsciously.

[You mean to say I came in stronger, so Ars turned into an even more troublesome opponent?]

[—That’s what I think. The stronger the opponent, the more he evolves… it could be phrased like that.]

Strength.

Flexibility.

Reflexes.

The speed of his blade-whips.

Regeneration speed.

Everything.

[However… if we use tactics like we did earlier, we might manage a temporary “win”. But… unless we can completely destroy whatever critical part of Ars exists, that win would just be nullified by his regeneration. And even as he regenerates… he’ll continue fighting.]

Even if he’s reduced to just chunks of flesh— He’ll keep moving.

Evolving.

[…What a headache.]

[Yeah.]

We can’t find any way to deal with him.

[The true core being in the remaining torso, there’s such a possibility but…]

[…Hmm.]

I weakly agree with Gio, but there’s no argument from him.

He knows it too.

Going after the torso, which might not even be the critical spot, is too risky.

(If anything, Gio’s point about limited regeneration seems like the more likely…)

Right now, both of us are injured.

Gio’s lost an arm.

The katana he was holding in the severed arm now lies on the ground.

Noticing my gaze, Gio speaks up.

[Anyway, that blade over there got a crack in it from the earlier fight. And it feels like that b*stard’s body is even harder now…]

Though not as badly as Gio’s, my own arm is injured too.

It’s hard to keep delivering fatal blows in our current state.

And most importantly— there’s no guarantee we could take him down even if we did.

[Guh…]

A stronger opponent, continuing to regenerate.

Evolving.

Getting steadily stronger.

Continuing to fight against him, it was clear we would only weaken little by little.

(Even if we target this so-called “core”… the odds are stacked against us, and we can’t even pinpoint its exact location. If there’s a chance of winning…)

For example.

We’d need overwhelming combat power, enough to slice him into pieces within moments.

(And… frustratingly, neither of us has that power right now.)

Alternatively.

It would be good if we could come up with some kind of clever strategy— but that idea is nowhere to be found.

I brace my legs and prepare my sword.

And then, I think.

(…Liz)

[I’m sorry, Gio. We have to retreat.]

[Ou.]

[Hm, this is unexpected… You listened surprisingly well.]

[You got that guy’s seal of approval. When it comes to fighting, I trust your judgment.]

[Can you still run?]

[You can see it for yourself— my legs are still working.]

I look for the opportunity to flee—

No.

There is no opportunity.

Not against this Divine Servant.

By the time I realized it, Gio and I were already running.

At this point, we can only pray.

For the chance to meet up with an ally who has the power to “slice” Ars into pieces.

From behind us.

I feel like— I heard his voice.

[                     — I will kill you. —                     ]

A distorted voice.

(…For the first time since we encountered him)

That wasn’t a quotation from the past.

(Perhaps—)

It could be a voice— words spoken by Ars himself.

---

**403 - Surely, These Were Gifts from my Father and Mother**

Ars seeks battle.

This Divine Servant does not forgive those who turn their backs on battle.

Ars deemed them a worthy opponent.

In a way, perhaps that was their misfortune.

---

I was running through the labyrinth’s corridors with Gio.

Right now, Ars was about 30 reters behind, chasing us.

We had tried to get ahead a few times, but after a brief defense, we changed direction and somehow managed to escape.

[Are you alright, Gio!?]

[Hahh… hahh… Looks like you’d be faster than me in a race…]

[You’ve taken a serious wound… In situations like this, I should buy us some time.]

I focused on listening carefully. I could faintly hear Ars’ footsteps.

Still, footsteps are generally absorbed by the walls.

Therefore, I had to keep checking Ars’ position by sight.

I turned my face back to the front.

Little by little.

The gap between us and Ars was closing.

(That Divine Servant’s strength… Is it proportional to “the strength of us two”…? If that’s the case… If I let Gio escape first and face him alone— will he drop back to the strength he had when he was just facing me? The strength he had when I first encountered him…)

If that’s the case…

(If I stay behind to buy time, maybe I can get the injured Gio away first…)

Gio, still catching his breath…

[I don’t know how exactly you’re feeling responsible, but don’t even think about staying behind and buying time, got it?]

[But… if my guess is right, that would be the best way to buy time.]

[Even with one arm, I’m stronger than you.]

[This isn’t about that.]

[Hahh… hahh… Your face right now… it looks like you’re about to face death.]

[—]

[There’s someone waiting for you to come back alive… right!?]

From behind, I heard Ars’ voice.

[ ” Don’t run away—! If you escape now, you’ll probably run for the rest of your life! If you don’t stand your ground now, when will you?! You ran from the Golden Eyes before… you lost someone important, right?! Are you going to lose someone again by running away?! Leaving behind the child, the memento of the person you lost?! I mean… What about that monster with the human face and Golden Eyes… What’s the big deal? If I kill it, I can! That Golden Eyes with human face is going down! I’ll kill it! I swear I will… So, I leave my comrades and the other Golden Eyes to you! I’ll kill that one! I’ll kill it— kill it, kill it, kill it! I’ll kill it! ” ]

His words sounded full of desperate resolve.

Perhaps those were words Ars had said when he fought a Human-Faced back when he was human.

Gio glanced behind to gauge the distance between us and Ars.

[We’re still fine…]

[ ? ]

[When it comes to this kind of thing, the ones waiting are the ones who suffer more.]

[…!]

[So, don’t say anything stupid for the sake of the ones waiting for you!]

[…Sorry.]

[Well— having a strong sense of responsibility isn’t a bad thing.]

I smiled softly.

[What’s with that?]

[Well… I think I heard something similar from Touka before.]

[Yeah, he’d say that.]

[…?]

[I can totally see him saying that.]

I see.

I could see why Touka had a favorable impression of this black Leopardkin warrior.

(…That said, what should we do?)

The distance between us was closing slowly.

Ars had probably stopped trying to get ahead because the gap was closing too quickly.

He may have been thinking that at this rate, he would catch up.

(Should I drop my weapons to lighten the load? No… Considering that he might evolve to a speed just a bit faster than ours… It’s too dangerous to give up weapons that could help me defend myself in a fight.)

There’s also the risk of discarded weapons being thrown at us from behind.

Even now, I couldn’t be sure when Armia’s sword might come flying at us.

(Maybe dropping my weapons goes against the warrior’s code… But if I gave up the “weapons” we discarded, he might not hesitate to use them…)

Gio was probably keeping his katana with him, cautious of that.

If that wasn’t the case…

It would be better for both of us if I hold onto the lighter Magic Sword I had…

[Divine Servant… I didn’t realize they could be this troublesome.]

Gio muttered irritably.

[But, the information we gathered in our fight with Ars might be invaluable. If we happen to meet an ally capable of defeating that Divine Servant, at least they wouldn’t have to go through the same close-quarters battle we did— And… maybe, our information will be the key to victory.]

I turned forward and continued.

[It’s definitely worth passing on.]

Gio tried to speak again.

But I raised a finger to my lips, signaling for silence.

[—There’s someone ahead.]

And then, those figures appeared.

There were five medium-sized Sacraments.

Gio asked.

[Can you handle them?]

[We have no choice but to.]

Without stopping, the two of us took an attacking stance.

[Listen, don’t stop running… just focus on charging through— any that you miss will just be dragged along.]

[Understood.]

[—Let’s go.]

Without losing any momentum, the two of us swung our blades as we charged through.

We cut down three of the five, continuing to rush forward.

But…

(Guh…)

It wasn’t possible to maintain full speed without slowing down even slightly.

Then, when I turned to check on Ars, what I saw was—

” ! “

The two Sacraments we had missed, their torn bodies fluttering through the air.

[ ” It doesn’t matter if you’re enemy or ally! Don’t get in the way of my fight! Uwooooohhhhh—! ” ]

The gap with Ars was closing even more.

(At this rate—)

I gritted my teeth and faced forward.

(Guh… —, …Focus.)

Somehow…

[—, …Gio, listen carefully!]

I shouted, pushing my voice out as much as I could.

[I recognize this path! I’m sure it splits ahead, left and right! We’ll split into two and escape! Got it!?]

[Huh!?]

[It’s all or nothing! We have to join up with allies who can fight that monster with the seemingly endless regeneration! Of those of us with information on him— one of us has to tell them! The distance to that Divine Servant is already under 20 reters! He’ll be close enough to strike with his whip-blades soon! If things keep going like this— he’ll catch up! Then, even if we split up… one of us must pass on the information we got from fighting Ars! We must hold on!]

[You… what are you—]

[First— we’ll keep charging straight ahead, drawing Ars with us! Let’s go!]

[—Tch, fine! I told you! I trust your judgment! I won’t go back on the words I said earlier!]

[You have my gratitude!]

We passed through the corridor and emerged into a wider space.

There was another passage ahead in this room.

Just as I remembered, it split ahead.

Gio and I, having entered the room, aimed for the path directly across from us.

A bit delayed, Ars also leaped into the room and started following us.

[ ” WAAAAAAAAIT—! WAIT A D*MN MINUUUUUUUTE—! ” ]

I turned back.

Perhaps because we had been running so hard.

Thud!

Unable to slow down in time, I crashed into the white wall of the room with my back.

[Ugh…!]

---

My ears… my hearing.

This is my strong point that perhaps surpass Gio’s.

Back when I fought alongside Ashinto and Duke Zuan’s personal soldiers—

It was my hearing that allowed me to accurately assess their numbers.

Even in this labyrinth, which muffles sounds, if I concentrate, I can pick up on sounds and presences ahead of me.

That man also relied on this ear of mine.

Other than that— there’s also my ability to sense presence.

When I fought against Ars earlier, I quickly detected Gio’s approach.

Because I was able to notice “that” ahead of time.

The ability to grasp such a thing.

Surely, these were gifts from my father and mother.

Thanks to them, I could “get ahead” and notice things.

Additionally— my voice, when I gave it my all, was within reach.

I could perceive that too.

Thus, I should have been able to convey it.

This time, unlike with Gio earlier, it wasn’t a loud voice to drown things out— but rather, a loud voice to convey something.

I included a “trick” in my words so that Ars wouldn’t notice, but—

If it’s that man…

I’m sure he’ll pick up on it.

I’m sure he’ll make use of it.

I’m sure—

He’ll take the best possible action.

That is something I can trust he’ll do.

---

My eyes captured it.

The silver-haired woman opening her mouth…

[                     Binding Curse, Unleash.                     ]

The shining blade of the Princess Knight, stepping forward, deflecting the approaching whip blades.

And seeing the black-clad man with scorching eyes…

His outstretched arm directed towards Ars—

[—Paralyze-—]

I called out the man’s name.

[Touka.]

---

**404 - Last Words**

While moving—

Seras was amplifying her ability to catch sounds slightly using the power of the Wind Spirits as she moved.

However, as a frontline fighter, Seras needed to remain vigilant of her surroundings.

Her role was to handle defense in case of an ambush by Vysis or her Divine Servants.

Thus, the one tasked with acting as a sensor was Pigimaru.

Focusing solely on being a sensor without considering combat, Pigimaru heightened its sensitivity.

For that reason, Pigimaru was the first to notice.

Because of this early detection, we had enough time, albeit brief, to prepare before Eve arrived.

We waited in a position not visible from the passage and launched a skill at the edge of its range.

Ideally, I would have liked to use -Sleep-.

That would have been better for aiming to incapacitate in one strike.

However, given the unknown combat capabilities of the enemy, I judged that the shorter range of -Sleep- posed too much risk.

I also couldn’t help worry about Munin.

Having her being too close to the enemy was dangerous.

Conversely, being too far from Seras and me was equally risky.

Thus, we decided to initiate the attack from a position where Seras could stay relatively close to Munin.

---

The Forbidden Curse unleashed by Munin.

When it had been used on Kirihara Takuto in the past, a sound resounded.

It sounded like something bursting.

That must have been the sound of -Dispel Bubble- being destroyed.

The Forbidden Curse materialized, forming into a semi-transparent chain that eroded the Divine Servant with the appearance of a white knight.

But this time— there was no sound.

Considering the possibility of them being enchanted, we still opted to use the Forbidden Curse but…

As Loqierra had anticipated, -Dispel Bubble- hadn’t been casted.

[— - Paralyze - —]

[ ” Oi!? What is— ” ]

—Crack, Snap—

Paralysis effect— successful.

[ - Ber—]

[ F o u n d    y o u . ]

[—serk - !]

From the gaps in Ars’ armor, a fountain of red blood gushed out vigorously.

Amidst it all, Ars was pointing at Seras.

I was already moving on to my next action.

At this range, I might as well—

[ - Dark - ! …]

[ ” ! ? My vision… has been taken away!? I can’t… see anything!? Kuh… Stay calm… Remember what Master taught me… Don’t rely solely on sight… The wind… the wind… The presence of life… The “form”… will guide me! Stay calm… me! ” ]

Even while spewing blood— he’s still moving.

He hasn’t succumbed to death.

I can hear a voice from the darkness within his helmet…

He’s speaking while spurting blood.

Probably why his words are so fragmented.

…Or rather…

The blood.

Is it… flowing backward inside his body?

[… - Poison - !]

Ars’ white body began turning purple.

Bubbles indicating poison appeared on his body as well.

After this… Will the continued damage be enough to take him down—

[…]

Still, around Ars, those blade-like tentacles were moving.

As if to protect him.

Those must be— the “blade whips” Eve mentioned earlier huh…

[ ! ]

Ars dropped to one knee on the ground.

However, the blade whips…

[…What is this?]

Their speed and intensity were rapidly increasing.

Clearly.

His blood— continues to gush out.

It’s probably because Ars is forcing himself to move.

Blood gushes out of his body… then flows back into his body again…

He should still be poisoned, but…

Is… the damage getting through?

It’s impossible to guess from his expression.

It’s hard to tell exactly what “state” Ars is in right now.

If Loqierra’s intel is correct.

Even Seras’s truth detection might not work effectively against him.

Most of all…, —

[…]

Should I trust in the efficacy of -Poison- and wait for him to die?

I’m not quite sure… if the poison is contributing to the damage.

Before I knew it, the bubbles from the poison were gone.

The discoloration on his body seemed to be fading—, …

…What do I do?

Should Seras use her Origin Regalia to finish this in one blow?

Should I get closer myself… and try to put him to sleep with -Sleep-…

[Touka!]

Eve’s voice.

[There is something I need to tell you!]

I kept my eyes on Ars and listened to Eve’s words.

Eve summarized the key points of the information she had gathered while fighting Ars.

During that time, Ars remained kneeling in place without moving.

But the blade whips extended and attacked.

Eve interjected to say its range had increased compared to their last fight.

While Seras deflected the blade whips, I finished hearing the information.

[…I see.]

[Of course, that’s assuming my theory is correct.]

[No… judging from Ars’ behavior, it doesn’t seem wrong… It’s probably better to act based on that assumption.]

In other words.

Using Origin Regalia could be a gamble.

Earlier, Ars pointed at Seras and said—

“Found you.”

That phrase carried a distinctly strong sense of “will”.

If that meant “he found the target Vysis instructed him to seek”…

Wouldn’t he have pointed at Munin or me instead?

If that’s the case, then it means…

He found “the one he wants to fight”.

According to Eve’s theory, this interpretation seems highly likely.

Looking at it the other way…

It could also mean “he has encountered the perfect prey to trigger further evolution”.

In that sense…

[Using Origin Regalia here might provoke even more undesirable evolution.]

Eve said.

[…On the other hand, do you think it’s worth taking the chance to finish him off with the Origin Regalia?]

[Honestly… I don’t know. I thought maybe we could tear him into pieces… but I can’t be sure.]

[If Seras uses Origin Regalia, it’s highly likely she’d cut him to pieces… it could also make him completely unbeatable.]

[If we’re doing it, I’ll join in too.]

That voice came from Gio Shadowblade, who seemed to have regrouped with Eve.

Noticing something, I spoke.

[…Gio, the equipment that Divine Servant is using—]

[We’ll deal with that later.]

Gio cut me off and continued.

[We can’t check that until we kill him first.]

[—Got it. If you’re joining, Gio… you and Eve protect Munin.]

In this case…

If Seras moves to finish him, I should approach as backup too.

That’s why I asked the two of them to guard Munin.

There’s also the possibility of reinforcements arriving through other passages.

I confirmed something with Gio first.

[Are your injuries okay?]

[With Eve’s support, I’m good enough to deflect the blade whips.]

[—I see.]

Eve and Gio moved to guard Munin.

If our conversation had been heard by Ars—

[ ” Even if… I kill humans… I won’t gain… Soul Power… What are you saying, Vysis… They’re still alive… Those I’ve killed… Even without Soul Power… They’re still living… inside me! They’re still alive! In my heart! Don’t— Don’t insult them! The dead… the warriors who fell by my hand! …Huh? I’m crazy? Me…? ” ]

…There doesn’t seem to be any notable reaction.

The content of the words doesn’t seem to have any significant meaning in the current situation either.

It seems difficult to apply a truth judgment to this.

[…]

Ars isn’t just affected by -Paralyze-.

He’s also had -Berserk-, -Dark-, and -Poison- layered on him.

And yet…

Now, it’s no longer just the blade whips.

Ars himself…

[ ” Just with techniques… I want to fight… With the Soul Power… With the Goddess’ Blessing… I’ve become too strong… but if we’re fighting with just techniques— with just skills… If it’s justjustjustskillskillskillskillskillskill, under the same conditions… I can fifififight… A battle above blades— is one— itititit shall be! ” ]

He stood up.

[…]

—What the heck is this?

The blood in his body…

At first, it seemed like it was spurting out— then it immediately flowed backward.

As though it were being played in reverse.

Moreover, not just the bubbles, even the discoloration on his body had nearly returned to white.

This…

Is he healing beyond the damage inflicted by the poison?

His white armor— thick veins like leaf veins were visible all over his body.

Blood spurted most violently from Ars’ thigh.

Probably due to the influence of -Berserk-, he was trying to charge forward.

And that spurted blood… like a reversed spray, it also returned to his body…

[…]

I suppose I should test it out huh.

[Seras.]

[Understood.]

Seras…

She understands everything without needing further instructions.

As soon as I move, Seras understands everything.

She steps forward— and I follow her back.

She still hasn’t used her Origin Regalia yet.

With just the Blade of Light, for now, she can still manage—

Seras closes in on Ars.

Ars’ sword, swung with arms that are twitching unnaturally from the spurting blood and the reverse flow.

Seras’s Blade of Light deflects it in the midst of a diagonal strike.

Ars— now brimming with brutal intent, is in a completely battle-ready state.

The -Berserk- Skill no longer seems to mean anything against him.

The blade whips surrounding us, aiming to encircle me and Seras…

I gave up on evading.

The range of Ars’ six blade whips now.

With the speed of Seras Ashrain’s single sword…

It surpassed all of them.

[ — - Sleep - — ]

[ ” Good… nigh—“… “—Good morning! Today is also a good “Good nigh “Good mo “Good ni “Good mo “Good mo “Good ni” “Good “Nigh “Goodmomomomomogoodnininininininini— ]

[…]

This guy…

Is he repeating sleeping and waking up?

Eve had mentioned it earlier.

His seemingly infinite regeneration.

[Touka-dono…]

[— …Take some distance.]

[Yes!]

With Seras intercepting Ars’ attacks, we took distance.

Ars was staggering.

But even in this unsteady state, he…

[The gap… is narrowed.]

Or rather—

[ ” Everyoneoneoneoneone’s deadeadeadeadeadead— I— I killedkilledkilledkilledkilledkilledkilled them— whywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhy thathathathat look on youryouryouryour face, Vysiiiiiiiiiiis—? Whowhowhowhowho— amamamam I— WHO AM I!? ” ]

As if he was straight out of a badly done clay animation—

Or perhaps…

From an anime with scenes missing, making it a distorted animation…

Ars began to move.

His body started twisting— yet moving with a seamless precision, he began closing in.

It seemed as though his form was gradually deviating from a human shape.

Asymmetrical horns began to sprout from his body.

And then— his mouth.

The lower half of his helmet opened like flower petals, revealing his mouth.

Red gums and golden teeth.

The inside of the mouth was filled with darkness.

[ ” Vysi… Vysisisis…! I— I— I’m scared—Before I knew it— I’ve killed— too many— Killkillkill me— please— kill me! ” ]

…It seems that it wasn’t just my imagination after all.

Since I casted -Dark- earlier, that feeling had been lingering inside me.

And now… it felt as though that sensation had become definitive.

This thing is dangerous.

He’s unlike the Human-Faceds…

Civit…

The Heroes…

Even that sh\*tty Goddess.

I couldn’t place him the same as any of them— and that unsettles me.

“Evolution”

Eve had said that this follower was evolving through battle.

…Ars’ words don’t seem to make sense as “conversation”.

But based on the content, could it be…

Was he once a hero that even Vysis couldn’t handle…?

A former Hero who begged Vysis to “kill him”?

—It’s quite clear now.

This one is likely not something that can be reasoned through.

My instincts are telling me…

If I let this thing “evolve” further… something catastrophic will happen—

[Seras.]

I called out to Seras, who had been watching Ars while maintaining her battle stance.

[Yes.]

As expected, I still want her to conserve her Origin Regalia.

I felt even more strongly about it during this battle.

I’ve realized just how necessary Seras’s “sword” is for handling my Abnormal State Skills.

I must avoid her being completely exhausted here at all costs.

There certainly is Sogou Ayaka, who is a close-range fighter of equal rank as her here.

However— no one else can adapt to me like Seras can.

[I’m counting on you.]

[I understand!]

With my step forward, Seras understood everything.

At the same time— Ars closed in.

His movements, once like a distorted clay animation…

—were now becoming more “coherent”.

He was evolving further.

I felt a sharp determination coming from Seras’s back.

Seras spoke briefly.

[I’m sorry— I will use it just a bit.]

[…I leave that to you.]

Seras activated her Origin Regalia, but only from the elbows down.

Ars’ blade whips— now more ominous and faster.

And even under the effect of five Abnormal State Skills, Ars spoke.

[ ” I will become strongstrongstrongeeeeeeer ” I will winwinwinwinwin this fight ” Vysisisisisisi ” I won’t lololololose ” This will be easyyyyyy ” Peacepeacepeacepeacepeace ” I will definitelylylylylylyly save youuuuuuuuuu ” Killkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkill ■■■■■■—]

He took a definite stance.

[              I w■l ki■ you              ]

—This distance, created for me by Seras—

[ — - Freeze - — ]

I deactivated all my other skills— and casted -Freeze-.

[ “— ” —Ah.]

…Crack… Snap… Crunch…

Ars’ body began to freeze.

The movement of the blade whips also came to a halt.

[—]

…Evolution, huh.

The gradual development of something.

In other words— It’s an act that needs “development”.

But -Freeze- has the power to “stop” things from moving.

…Well, I could come up with all sorts of explanations.

But honestly—

This was the only method that came to my mind.

If Seras used her complete Origin Regalia, we might be able to deal with him.

But I’m not even sure if this Ars actually has that core Eve spoke of.

And while I don’t fully understand the logic of it all…

It seemed that, over time, my Abnormal State Skills had become nearly ineffective against him.

Even if I used -Slow- now, I can’t see a clear path to victory by myself.

The evolving monster— Divine Servant Ars.

So the last thing that came to mind was a skill that would “stop” him.

Development, evolution— A skill that stops everything.

The first test subject bug.

Kirihara Takuto.

There was only one slot left in the limit of three targets for this skill.

For my Abnormal State Skill -Freeze-— that was my last shot.

[…]

Seras and I maintained some distance, keeping ourselves in a battle-ready stance.

Ars’ feet… had stopped.

The lower half of his body was already frozen.

…Slow.

Compared to the bug and Kirihara, the freezing speed is clearly slower.

Is this guy also “adapting”— evolving to counter -Freeze-?

…What now?

No… as usual— I’ll have to come up with the next move somehow.

[No matter how it turns out… there must be a way.]

I kept my thoughts active.

Always think.

Think of the next move.

[ ” I give you… my thanks… Vy… sis… I am… too dangerous… I… Ars Monroy… should disappear… from this world… An existence… that should be erased… ” ]

Ars reached out toward us.

As though trying to grab something.

I, along with Seras, continued to stare at Ars, still in battle stance.

And— I continued thinking.

Should we retreat now or not…

Perhaps… —

…Crack, snap…

The ice spread, encroaching on the white Divine Servant.

[ ” Hey, Vysis, last question… Can I ask something? ” ]

Ars said.

[ ” If the two of us fought— who would be stronger? ” ]

With those last words, Ars—

[—]

Was completely encased in ice…

And then, fell silent.

At that moment, Eve spoke up.

[…Is it over?]

[Status Open.]

I brought up the skill menu.

The number of -Freeze-’s target limit displayed was -3/3-.

This meant— -Freeze- had indeed worked on Ars.

[Doesn’t seem like… he’s gonna be moving anymore.]

It took a while for it to fully take effect, but now Ars was in the same state as the bug and Kirihara.

[There’s still a chance he might start moving again… but for now, assuming it worked, we have to move forward. Ideally, we’d toss him somewhere and make sure he can’t do anything if he comes back to life… but within this labyrinth and us being this close by, there doesn’t seem to be a convenient place like that…]

While he’s in this state, the skill likely renders any attack ineffective.

That had already been confirmed during tests with the bug.

If attacks had been able to break the target, it would have freed up a slot in the skill’s target limit.

I tried every destructive method I could think of, but none succeeded.

Gio, staring at the frozen Ars, spoke.

[In short, we just leave this guy here, right?]

[Exactly.]

[Touka.]

Eve stepped in front of me.

[Once again… thank you. I owe you.]

[Without the information Eve gathered beforehand, I might have had Seras use her complete Origin Regalia. Considering Ars’ characteristics, that would have likely been a pointless waste of energy. In that sense, your— your and Gio’s contributions were invaluable.]

[Fufu… You’re as smooth-talking as ever.]

[Pigii!

[You’ve been a great help too, Pigimaru.]

[Speaking of contributions, I was also protected by Eve-san and everyone, right?]

Munin joined the conversation with a light chuckle, her hand covering her mouth.

She was as good as ever at diffusing tension.

…Though her shoulders trembling slightly betrayed how frightened she must have been.

[Thank you as well, Gio-san.]

[Well… you’re a comrade from the Faraway Country after all.]

Munin smiled warmly.

[Yes, comrades.]

Gio glanced at Ars and Armia’s equipment that had been frozen along with him.

[…For now, let’s head for the castle.]

Looking toward the castle, he spoke.

[Whether Armia’s alive or dead… We can’t know right now. Sometimes, people you think are alive turn out to be dead. Other times, those you thought dead are still alive. For now, it’s anyone’s guess. That said— she chose this, knowing the risks. Even if she’s dead, that’s the path she decided to take. But if she is dead…]

Gio tightened his grip on his sword.

[Then we have to make sure we stop that damned goddess’s schemes, or she’ll never rest in peace.]

As Armia became the topic, Munin’s previously cheerful expression darkened.

Seras looked at Gio with a hint of sorrow.

[Gio-dono…]

[I appreciate the concern but… now’s not the time to worry about whether Armia’s alive or dead.]

And so, Gio said:

[Let’s see this through the end— Fly King.]

[…—Yeah.]

Leaving the frozen Ars behind, we exited the room.

---

**405 - Sacred Eye Defense Battle**

**-Yasu Tomohiro POV-**

I stared into the distance at the approaching Sacraments.

My heart was pounding heavily.

—Yeah, I’m scared.

Before the battle at the Anti-Demon White Castle, I didn’t feel this way.

If anything, I was more excited back then.

And… I wasn’t able to see anything clearly.

Now, I’m stronger than I was then.

But for some reason, I’m so much more terrified now.

It was the same when I fought those giant apes.

[…]

The soldiers lined up on the ramparts caught my eye.

Are they not scared?

They all look so calm.

Maybe it’s because they’re trained.

As I wondered, I overheard a conversation nearby.

[…Before I left home, my kid said something.]

[Hm?]

[He said, “I’m not scared”.]

[Hehh, gutsy kid you’ve got there.]

[No, that’s not it… That’s not it.]

[What did he say?]

[He said, “It’s okay because Dad’s going to protect us”.]

[…I see.]

[Ever since surviving that last battle against the Demon Emperor’s Army… the way my kid looks at me has changed. He looks at me with admiration now, like he looks up to me…]

[Same here… My wife, I mean.]

[The one who’s always nagging you?]

[Yeah… But ever since that last fight, she’s been a little kinder, you could say…]

[…Well, I guess we’ve both gotta survive this one too, huh?]

[Yeah.]

[…]

The soldier talking about his kid suddenly lowered his face.

He leaned on his spear as though using it to support himself.

It looked like he might collapse if he let go even a little.

He was sobbing.

[—Fghh… Guh… I don’t want to die… I’m scared… I’m so scared…]

[O- Oi… I get it, but, y’know… You gotta think of the morale…]

The other soldier looked around nervously.

Thereupon…

[It’s fine.]

Another soldier who had been listening placed a hand on the sobbing soldier’s shoulder.

[…We’re all the same. Everyone’s scared. I’m scared too. But we still fight— right?]

[Sniff… Yeah… If we lose here, my kid will die, right…? So… I’ll do it… Sniff… I’ll fight…]

The other soldiers reacted in various ways.

Some gave wry, yet gentle smiles.

Some were moved to tears.

Some kept their expressions stoic but seemed to have steeled their resolve…

[…]

So that’s how it is.

Everyone is scared.

It’s not just me who feels this way…

That’s right.

It’s not strange to feel fear.

Something like this— would scare anyone.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve been gripped by a certain feeling.

When compared to others, am I the most worthless person in the world?

Sometimes, such a thought strikes me out of nowhere.

Even now, it hits me, like an attack.

It feels like everyone else is living their lives better than I am.

Like I’m the only one in this world with such flawed feelings.

Like I’m the only one doing something fundamentally wrong with how I live.

Somehow— just barely scraping by.

Even when I find people who seem like kindred spirits, they always seem to manage.

Even though we’re in the same country—

It felt as though everyone else was from another nation entirely.

And so—

“Am I the only one truly feeling fear here?”

That thought crept into my mind.

(But… That might not be the case.)

I lowered my gaze to my hands.

Then I looked again at the soldiers.

I could see it.

Now— more than before.

I could see the “faces” of the others around me.

Thinking I was the only one—

That was probably because I couldn’t see anything but myself.

[Fear’s not all bad.]

At that moment, Rinji spoke up.

[Feeling scared means you’re facing it, without running away.]

[Facing it…]

For instance, with horror movies.

“I wasn’t scared.”

“I don’t get what was supposed to be scary.”

I used to think people who felt that way were stronger at heart.

Even after being summoned to this world.

Coming to a different world— gaining extraordinary powers.

I thought the ones who faced battles without fear were the true “heroes”.

Rinji continued.

[You’re scared because you’re confronting it head-on.]

[—]

“That’s why…”, Rinji continued.

[Having the courage not to run from that fear— that’s what real bravery is.]

…Ahh, I see.

That, too, is another form of “hero”.

Even when they held resolve and determination— the feeling of “fear” remains, lingering somewhere deep inside.

It was the same when I fought those golden-eyed apes.

(But…)

I wonder why?

A soft smile unconsciously spread across my face.

(Even if I’m scared, it’s okay.)

I can fight with this “fear” in my heart.

I tightened my expression once more.

[…This battle.]

I firmly locked my gaze onto the approaching Sacraments.

[To protect everyone— I’ll throw everything I have.]

---

The Sacraments began to reveal their individual forms from the white mass.

Their ranks spread out sideways.

Far behind the formation, a vast army continued.

At the very least, it could be estimated that there were no fewer than 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers.

As Rinji said, that’s something quite clear even when looking from here.

On the walls, the magical artillery and archers were preparing to intercept.

Even the bowguns, configured for placement, were being cranked up.

Rinji narrowed his eyes.

[They’ve prepared… a trebuchet huh.]

[Not just a trebuchet.]

[Lili.]

Before I knew it, Lili of the Drunken Sword Party had joined us.

She motioned toward the Sacraments, which was raising a cloud of dust.

[They’ve brought siege towers too. They probably didn’t bring them directly from Alion; they likely assembled them on the move as they got closer to the Capital.]

[That… rather large cart over there?]

[It might be tough for regular humans… but they’ve got tireless Sacraments over there, and they even have some Sacraments that are many times larger than humans. Carrying and assembling the parts doesn’t work the same way as it would for us.]

Siege towers— also called siege turrets, as their name suggests, are siege weapons.

Normally, soldiers climb the wall with ladders.

But with a siege tower, it’s easier to send soldiers to the top of high walls.

Back in my original world, I had seen movies and manga make use of such weapons.

Rinji scratched his head.

[I don’t want to think about it… but the thought of that massive army crowding onto this wall…]

[It’s not just siege towers… They might have brought weapons and horses from the fortresses and strongholds like Magnar along the way.]

There were half-horse Sacraments, but there are also Sacraments riding regular horses.

Of course, they were armed.

Lili spoke.

[These Sacraments… They seem smarter than when we were commanding them. They’ve probably gained more abilities.]

“They were once limited to simpler orders.”, she added.

At that moment,

[PREPARE FOR ATTAAAAAACK—!]

The command was given, and the war horn sounded.

The vibrations, almost like a small tremor, reached us.

The battle was truly drawing near.

[According to the Queen and the Saintess’ plan, it seems we’re not going to strike out, but instead, we’re focusing on defense and observing the enemy’s movements. The gates are also sealed with rocks from the inside, so for now, the battering rams shouldn’t be able to break through but—]

[…! Here they come!]

Suddenly, the activity on the walls grew frantic.

The Sacraments hadn’t yet reached the range for Attack Magic or arrows, but we, too, saw “it”.

Before we knew it,

Everyone was looking up at the sky.

And above the walls, something square like a box easily passed over.

Everyone was looking up.

Lili’s eyes widened.

[—What the hell is that?!]

The use of trebuchets had been anticipated.

The walls were strong enough to withstand all kinds of destruction.

It had also been expected that the enemy might try making use of projectiles that “cross over the wall” like stones.

But what was thrown, landing inside the First Guardian Wall, was a box made of what appeared to be metal.

Its size was roughly equivalent to a medium-sized room.

We moved and peered inside the First Guardian Wall.

Bam!

With a loud sound, one side of the box opened.

From inside…

[Are those… Sacraments inside…?!]

Yes, Sacraments were packed inside the box.

However, it seemed that quite a few of them had been crushed to death by the impact when they fell.

But not all of them.

Lili gritted her teeth.

[Guh… A plan forcibly made because they’re Sacraments huh.]

If it had been humans, it would have been nearly impossible to execute.

A normal soldier would have been crushed into a mess inside the box.

Or perhaps those were Sacraments specially adjusted for this purpose.

Still, the number of Sacraments inside wasn’t that many.

It seemed many had died from the impact when they landed.

Our forces near the Second Guardian Wall could easily wipe them out.

However, this situation— being attacked from behind, was enough to disrupt concentration.

“We’ve been breached.”

Somehow, it makes it so that feeling creeps inside our mind.

It spread like panic among the soldiers on the walls, lingering there.

Then…

[One box at a time is bad enough… but if they keep throwing them in like this, we’re in trouble.]

It didn’t matter if the Sacraments inside were crushed to death.

The enemy could keep doing this.

In fact,

[H- Here they come again—!]

One of the soldiers shouted.

The boxes containing Sacraments were being thrown one after another.

Some of them,

Fwoosh!

Were intercepted by the Sacred Eye in mid-air because they were too high up.

But the enemy didn’t care. They kept throwing them.

And in addition, large rocks were being hurled in as well.

This kind of regular stone-throwing had been anticipated in advance.

That was why there were few people inside the First Guardian Wall’s position right now.

So, the damage from the stones was minimal.

[Even so… Psychologically, it feels like we’re being overwhelmed. And… if those rocks hit the soldiers on the walls, they’ll be crushed.]

“We can’t move, yet we’re being attacked from a distance without retaliation.”

Indeed, it was mentally exhausting.

The regular stones were a nasty element, too.

Our forces near the Second Guardian Wall were slow to react.

Yes…

If they tried to eliminate the Sacraments inside the wall, they risked being crushed by falling rocks.

It was no surprise that it was difficult to advance psychologically.

And then—

Boom!

The soldiers’ eyes widened.

[W- What is that…?! An explosion?!]

It must have been a magic tool.

Or perhaps something that used gunpowder, if such a thing existed here.

One of the wooden boxes that had been thrown collided with a building and exploded.

Rinji clicked his tongue.

[That makes it even harder for our forces near the Second Guardian Wall to move out…]

The knight commanding the area near the wall where we were stationed turned toward the enemy army.

He muttered with frustration,

[Guh… our trebuchet can’t reach that distance…]

There were trebuchets set up inside the First Guardian Wall and along the top of the wall.

However, the range of our trebuchets didn’t match that of the enemy’s.

As could be seen from the box, the enemy could hurl larger rocks.

Then…

[Ah!]

A soldier on the opposite side, facing the outside of the First Guardian Wall, pointed and shouted.

We turned our attention toward it.

Massive Sacraments, one after another, began carrying shallow baskets on their shoulders.

Inside the baskets— once again, Sacraments were packed in.

[I see… before using their siege tower or ladders to send them up the wall, they intend to have those huge Sacraments cling to the wall and clear a “path” on top of the walls.]

Rinji’s words caused Lili to frown in frustration.

[If that’s the case, they can skip the process of climbing the wall… And if they secure the top of the wall and create a “path”, it’ll make it easier to send the follow-up forces through the siege towers and ladders.]

Moreover, we would have to split our forces to deal with the Sacraments that breached earlier, which meant diverting some of our wall forces.

[So they’re trying to shut down our defensive tactics… where we attempt to reduce the number of enemies climbing the wall as much as possible.]

Looking around, I could see that the soldiers on the wall were starting to get anxious.

The commanding knights tried to calm them down, shouting orders to maintain their composure.

During the previous grand invasion of the Great Demon Emperor, many of the elite soldiers from all the nations had fallen.

Well-trained soldiers had died in large numbers.

“The ones left here… their training is probably lower than that of the troops from the grand invasion.”

I recalled hearing such a thing.

Some of them were even civilian militia, poorly trained for battle.

The troops on the eastern wall had relatively high numbers of well-trained Magnar soldiers.

But even then, our numbers were simply not enough.

And to make up for the lack of numbers, a significant number of poorly trained soldiers had been added.

It wasn’t surprising, then, that some of them were starting to lose their composure.

Even so, they were still here.

They still gathered here.

To protect what was important.

No one could blame them.

As for me personally, I felt nothing but gratitude towards them—

“I don’t want to die…”

I remembered the man I had heard sobbing earlier on the wall.

Because the Sacraments had stopped moving while attacking from a distance, the Sacrament army was currently halted.

As I watched the enemy’s long, horizontally aligned formation, I turned to Rinji and spoke.

[If they get closer, I might be able to handle those huge Sacraments and siege weapons with my flames.]

[Your flames are powerful after all… I’ll leave them to you, Tomohiro.]

“However…”, I added.

[The number I can handle is limited.]

Rinji looked at me in confusion.

[Huh?]

The enemy’s army was spread out horizontally.

If they clung to the wall, how much could I move around on top of it?

How long would it take for me to move?

How much area could I cover?

In that case… —

[…]

As a thought crossed my mind, I gulped.

Then, I spoke.

[Could you… get confirmation on whether I’m allowed to leave through the gate and charge at them?]
