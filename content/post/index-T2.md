# **Pupil of the Wiseman Chapter 276 - Purchase**

Things had turned around entirely with the discovery that the sofa was not haunted, but inhabited by a spirit instead, making the owner incredibly excited.

「And so, let me ask you again. Will you sell that sofa to me?」

The owner looked like he was about to hug the sofa, if there was a way to realistically do it, when Mira asked him that. He jumped on his feet, looking embarrassed, and then replied with a bright smile.

「Of course!」  
「That’s good then. I thought you had gotten so attached to it that you wouldn’t want to part ways.」

Mira said that, half jokingly and half being serious, and the owner confessed that he did feel like that a bit, but he would make an exception.

「But knowing you’re the Spirit Queen, I’ll sell you anything you want!」  
「I appreciate that. So…how much will it cost?」

It was finally time to ask that very important question.

The truth behind the sofa would likely have a dramatic effect on its price, not to mention all the other similar antiques that had been treated as dangerous items. Their price would likely shoot through the roof once word spread around.

Especially the sofa, as it had been personally appraised by the Spirit Queen. The price of antiques relied heavily on their history, and Mira had left her autograph at Craftbell, Coffee and Antiques, which could serve as proof for the owner that she had been there, and personally examined the sofa.

In a way, if Mira had never revealed the existence of a spirit, and she was more business inclined, she could have obtained a far cheaper price tag if she never mentioned anything.

But Mira had been honest with the owner, mostly because she hoped that would change the fate of all other spirits in a similar situation. She had seen how much the owner loved antiques, so she was counting on him to spread the word to anyone else in the same trade.

Then again, she could have bought it first and then revealed the truth to achieve the same result. She would get a bargain, and still get to save the spirits.

But Mira had not done that because she had seen how much the owner loved antiques, so she wanted to make him as happy as possible. And she was not some merchant, but a fellow lover of spirits.

Not to mention that trying to get a cheaper deal like that could lead to rumors.

As an antique seller, he had likely seen that happen before with appraisals, but this was the first time something he considered unsellable had turned into something very unique. That made him genuinely happy, without having to feel like he was swindled out of a deal.

She would not be able to complain if he decided to charge her more, as she herself had done trading with Magic Sealing Stones before. She only hoped that it would be within her means.

「Let’s see…」

When Mira asked for a price, the owner’s face became more serious, looking at her and the sofa with a pensive stare.

「How about one million Rils?」

Eventually, he made up his mind, and named the price of the sofa with a smile. One million Rils. That was a quite large amount for Mira, especially when considering it was for a two seater sofa.

But things were a bit different when considering that it was an antique, that it housed a spirit, and all the costs of bringing those two teachers to examine it in the past.

All of that added up to the cost, and Mira realized that he was actually lowballing the price by a considerable amount. She had seen the price of most things when she looked through the shop earlier, so she had a general idea of the prices.

She also knew the price of things like spirit swords and other weapons, and the cheapest went for at least five million Rils. Even if there was such a big difference in the types of spirits, humans still had a great appreciation for them, and so the owner lowered the price to one million.

But what made her certain was his smile. She had seen him interacting with clients earlier, and it was different from how he looked now.

Before it was just a business smile, but now it was genuine, just like when he spoke of history and antiques that he loved so much. It was like he only wanted the sofa to be in the best hands possible.

「Hmm, are you sure about that?」

Mira asked just to be sure. The owner was giving up the opportunity to make a lot of money, and she felt slightly guilty about it. But the owner gave a reassuring nod.

「You’ve already done plenty, giving new hope to this sofa, and saving many other antiques that could be suspected of being haunted like it in the future.」

The owner told her with a cheerful voice, gently stroking the back of the sofa, and then added, 「Knowing I was of help to the Spirit Queen herself is reward enough.」

He had obtained that sofa for one million Rils himself, so usually he would sell it for more, especially considering all the new information about it. But he insisted that he did not mind selling it for the same price.

「Alright then, I’ll buy it!」

If the owner had made up his mind, then she had no complaints about it. She happily accepted that price.

「Thank you very much! I’ll go prepare the sale contract and proof of ownership documents, you can wait there if you want.」

He seemed really eager to complete the sale, so he quickly pointed to an area on the second floor with a desk and two chairs. That was likely the place where sales were signed on.

「Alright, I’ll do that.」  
「I’ll be right there!」

As Mira looked at that area, the owner swiftly ran off somewhere.

(I’ll have to go sell some more Magic Sealing Stones soon.)

Mira grimaced, realizing that she was nearly going to run out of money with this purchase. Then she headed to the desk, while pondering just how much of her stock she should sell.

On her way there, she constantly stopped to look at the antiques on display, as the second floor’s items had been hand-picked by the owner, making her daydream about whatever history was behind each one.

Then, she noticed one of the walls past the antiques, which was lined with hanging paintings.

They were of various sizes, but all were painted in vivid colors, almost like they were about to come to life. The brushwork was also the same across them, so they likely all came from the same painter.

「…I guess he’s into this too…」

Mira grimaced a little seeing those paintings. For some reason, they were all depicting girls, so the painter likely also had an obsession with them.

Considering their high quality, it would not have been strange to have a girl or two in the paintings, but when all of them did, it started to appear like a slightly different type of collection.

「Well, I guess everyone has their interests…」

That made her recall how enthusiastic he seemed to talk with her, but she tried to suppress that memory, so she could remember him simply as a man who loved antiques.

The area with the desk was also surrounded by a few small antiques, and as Mira looked at them, the owner returned in a hurry and had to take deep breaths.

「I’m back, sorry to keep you waiting.」

It was clear he had been in a rush, as he also passed a handkerchief across his sweaty forehead. His other hand held a few papers, and behind him was the sofa.

「Well, let’s start the paperwork, shall we?」  
「Sure.」

The owner waited for Mira to sit down before taking a seat himself, and then swiftly spread the documents on the desk. Then, under the owner’s guidance, she read through everything to make sure it was all in order.

「Once you have the one million Rils ready and have checked everything, please sign these agreement forms.」

Saying that, he brought forth a tray with two forms. She nodded and took out twenty gold coins, which added up to the one million Rils, placed them on the tray, and then picked up the fountain pen next to the forms and looked at them.

It was a rather wordy and lengthy document, but in short, it stated that the shop would not accept returns after a sale, unless they were defective in some way. But after a week, it did not matter if they were defective or not, and they would not be accepted. The shop also agreed to repair an item for free once.

「So I just sign here and here?」

After reading through everything, Mira did not have any issues with any of the sale terms, so she pointed to two blank spaces at the bottom of the page and asked that.

「Yes, right there.」

With the owner’s confirmation, Mira signed there. The owner checked it was right, and then gave her the second form as well.

「Is this good?」  
「Yes, thank you very much. Now I just need your seal or thumb print here, here, and here.」

When Mira finished signing, she returned the fountain pen, and the owner brought forth a red ink pad. Mira did as told, placing a thumb print above her signature, and then once across both pages, with half of it on each. The owner then kept one of the forms, while Mira kept the other alongside all the certificates and expert reports, which she stored in her Item Box.

「Then the paperwork is done. This sofa is officially property of the Spirit Queen now!」

With all the complicated paperwork done, the owner turned to the sofa, patting it and saying, 「I’m so happy for you,」 almost like it was his daughter who he was sending off to be married.

「Could I ask for another favor from you, Spirit Queen?」 Then the owner turned around, looking serious again as he spoke to Mira.

「Hm? A favor? What is it?」

Considering his obsession with antiques, Mira expected it would be something about repairs or warranties, but instead it was something she had not expected at all, though it was something she could have deduced.

「Please, let me take a commemorative photo!」 He opened a large box that was also on the table, taking a camera from it and turning to look at Mira, his eyes full of anticipation.

「A commemorative photo, you say…」

Mira had seen the preferences of the owner in the collection of paintings earlier, so for the first time she looked doubtful at him. He had been honest and forthright when it came to antiques, but now his intentions were less clear.

「Yes, it’ll serve as proof that the Spirit Queen was here and bought that sofa!」

As Mira pressed him on the issue, he seemed to ponder about it for a bit, before quickly saying that, and detailing his excuse, or explanation as it were.

According to him, her visit marked a turning point in the world of antiques, especially when it concerned those accused of being haunted, as a new hope had arrived for them.

「I’m not saying that all of them are good, I’m sure there’s some actually dangerous items amongst those secured by the church. But I’m sure most of them are spirits that have been mistaken for something worse. And I believe that all of them have been saved today, thanks to you. So what else would we do to commemorate this day?!」

His voice quivered with emotion as he said that, his love for antiques palpable.

「Well, if that’s how it is…」

Mira did not know much about antiques, so she felt like he was exaggerating. But helping spirits that had been sealed away for no reason was something she could rejoice in.

She still doubted that it merited taking a commemorative photo, so she stared intently at him, trying to discern if this was all motivated by certain tastes of his, that she had already witnessed in the paintings.

The owner noticed that she still needed some more convincing, so he stated another reason, saying, 「Actually, I have another concern…」

He continued mentioning how in the past, no one had ever found a way to deal with those antiques, so they had a pretty bad reputation.

Convincing everyone that they actually were inhabited by spirits was going to take a lot of work, since not even the most skilled of spellcasters had been able to see such spirits. The only way that would be possible, was by using the name of someone as famous as the Spirit Queen.

But the owner also mentioned that simply saying, 「The Spirit Queen told me so,」 would never convince anyone, and he needed more proof, as it was easy to make up such claims just to upsell something.

「That’s where a commemorative photo would help! Even the form you signed earlier could be forged. But a picture of you sitting on that very sofa would tell the actual story!」

The owner spoke with great emotion and exaggerated motions, doing everything he could to convince Mira of his explanation. And somehow, it seemed to work, as Mira’s doubtful gaze slowly softened.

He noticed that, and continued with enthusiasm.

「You, the Spirit Queen, who has ties to the Spirit King, could tell at first glance that there was a spirit in this sofa, even though no one else knew what to do with it. You found out that the gaze people were feeling from it was a spirit kindly watching over us. And you may not know this, but this sofa is actually quite well known in this line of work, thanks to all the efforts I went through with it. Anyone would be able to recognize it, so a picture of you on it would never be doubted!」

It was unusual for people to act so passionately and excited about something, it even felt like an act of desperation, pressuring Mira. But everything he said made sense as well. Mira had grown immensely famous all of a sudden, and the name of the one who caused that rise in popularity, the Spirit King, also added a lot of credibility to anything relating to spirits.

「I see…」

If they took a commemorative photo like the owner suggested, it could certainly help liberate all of those other spirits who had committed no sin.

And more importantly, Mira felt like she had to do something for those spirits. She had already decided to do anything for them, so everything the owner said made her actually want to take that picture.

Noticing that change in Mira, the owner picked up the camera with a glint in his eyes.

「Let’s take this photo, for the future of all antiques!」 The owner bowed with that final plea, his whole body filled with his love for antiques, and no room for suspicion.

「Sure, let’s do it!」 Mira also cast aside her doubt and happily obliged his request. All for the future of spirits.

「Thank you very much!」

The owner was glad to hear that, and then said he would prepare everything for the shoot, which would take around two hours. So Mira was free to go and come back when that was done.

He was really treating her like a model.

Mira left the shop while the owner prepared everything, while talking with the Spirit King about the spirits living in antiques.

Martel and the Spirit King seemed sad that those spirits were treated that way, as in the past, many thousands of years prior, while there were few Man-Made Spirits, people noticed them and valued them highly.

However, upon listening to the owner, they realized that there was no one left who appreciated these spirits in the same way. Had there been, someone like the owner, with his deep obsession for antiques, would surely have encountered and learned about them.

『He even said that the church is sealing them away, unaware of what they are. Anyone who serves the divine should be able to know it’s us just by being close, even if our presence is faint… I guess things have changed in the church as well.』

The Spirit King had spent what felt like an eternity without contact with the human world, and he muttered that with disappointment, but also knowing there was little that could be done about it.

『I know, things have definitely changed since then. Not just the scenery, but people as well.』

Martel had also been away in a similar way, and she was seeing the current world through Mira’s eyes. She sighed while wondering what had caused that. Her usual cheery voice also seemed more muted.

『I wonder why as well.』

The Spirit King harbored the same feeling, before asking, 『What do you think, Mira?』

That caught Mira off guard, as she felt that there was no way for her to know something that both the Spirit King and Martel were puzzled by, but after collecting her thoughts, she replied, 『Maybe it’s because people have less faith than before?』

Her reply was not based on current events or something she knew, but purely on her life experience in her previous world.

There were actual Gods, spirits, and even monsters and devils in this world, so faith here was rooted on something completely different to religion in her previous world. But her knowledge was fuzzy, as she had not spent too much time here yet.

『Hmm, less faith… But no, that would mean… Actually, I guess it could.』

The Spirit King did not seem fully convinced, but at the same time he seemed to think of something else. He then muttered that he would look into it later, and if he found anything he would update them.

# **Reborn as a Transcendent Chapter 620 – You May Make Heaps Of Profit, But I’ll Never Make A Loss**

“P… Princess, we can talk this over!” Leroy stammered as he scrambled backward, panic evident in his voice, while Yeager steadily closed the distance between them.

Standing beside him, Scarry was completely frozen in terror, his body refusing to obey even the slightest command.

“Negotiate? What’s there to negotiate? Just pay up for the mental damages you’ve caused me,” Yaeger declared coldly. She rubbed her hands together before tightly clenching her fists, the sharp crackle of her knuckles echoing ominously.

Leroy and Scarry exhaled in relief, believing the situation could still be salvaged. After all, if money could solve it, then it wasn’t truly a problem.

“In that case, Your Highness, how much compensation would appease you?” Scarry asked, bowing humbly.

“How much do you think is appropriate?” Yaeger replied with a sly smile. The mere mention of money filled her with unrestrained delight. After all, there was no quicker way to make money than fleecing the fraudsters themselves!

“Ten…” Leroy began, intending to propose ten million—a sum he believed would be sufficient to placate the terrifying figure before him.

Before he could finish, Yaeger cut him off. “One hundred million? How generous of you! I feel a bit guilty accepting such a large sum, but since you’ve offered so sincerely, I’ll graciously take it.”

The two of them stood dumbfounded, their minds struggling to process her audacious demand.

One hundred million? She was practically skinning them alive! Impossible! Absolutely not!

“Princess, we don’t have that kind of money,” Scarry said bitterly, his voice trembling. In the face of such an exorbitant demand, his pride crumbled into irrelevance. After all, he was still reeling from the catastrophic losses the Entertainment Center had suffered last time—a misfortune that had fallen upon him unfairly and left him devastated.

If he were forced to cough up another hundred million, Scarry knew his only escape might be a leap off the nearest roof.

‘Goodbye, cruel world… Wait, no, I’m still alive!’ Shaking his head to banish such thoughts, Scarry turned to Yaeger with pitiable eyes, hoping his despair might evoke her mercy.

“Princess, have mercy!” Leroy pleaded desperately, his hands clasped together in supplication. Despite his vast wealth, Leroy’s liquidity was woefully insufficient. Even if the amount were split evenly between him and Scarry, he would still be on the hook for fifty million.

Losing fifty million would plunge him into a dire cash flow crisis. In mere moments, these two once-mighty moguls had been reduced to groveling like desperate beggars.

“I’ve noticed your Entertainment Center brings in substantial profits daily. Asking for one hundred million as compensation isn’t unreasonable, is it? Consider this: I have a delicate body and a fragile mind. I’m just a weak girl, as frail as Mui-mui Lam. You two nearly scared me to death! It’s already generous of me to limit my request to a mere hundred million for mental damages.” Yaeger spouted her absurd claims with an air of solemnity.

‘Delicate body? Weak?’ Scarry and Leroy wondered if their ears had suddenly started playing tricks on them. Otherwise, how could they have heard something so utterly preposterous?

This woman, whose martial prowess could likely take down a rhinoceros with a single punch, had the audacity to compare herself to the frail actress… How utterly shameless!

The two exchanged glances, silently releasing a collective sigh. Scarry hurriedly spoke up, “Princess, while the Entertainment Center generates a lot of money daily, all of it belongs to the Xu Family. I don’t have access to those funds. I truly can’t afford one hundred million!”

After a brief moment of thought, he decided to take the risk and try negotiating with her.

“That’s right, Princess. We’re just employees of the Xu Family. There’s no way we can pay such a huge amount!” Leroy chimed in, echoing Scarry’s plea.

Yaeger remained quiet, her expression thoughtful as though she was considering their words. The tension in the room thickened with every passing second. Both men were now consumed by trepidation, their anxiety written plainly on their faces.

If she truly stood firm on the amount, they knew they’d have no choice but to scrape it together somehow. After all, their lives were far more valuable than their wealth. Money lost could always be earned back. But if they lost their lives, nothing else would matter.

Their bargaining efforts were merely a desperate attempt to delay the inevitable.

“Fine. I’m not a demon, after all. I’ll settle for fifty million in mental damages,” Yaeger sighed, her tone suggesting she had made a significant concession.

To the average observer, halving her initial demand might have seemed like a tremendous loss on her part. In reality, Yaeger hadn’t expended any effort at all yet was walking away with fifty million—a monumental victory for her.

Furthermore, she had no desire to drive them into utter despair. Harvesting leeks required skill and patience—one couldn’t simply yank them out of the ground prematurely.

‘Oh, my poor, damaged city. To repair you, I’ve resorted to such underhanded tactics. You’d better repay me in the future,’ Yaeger thought to herself with mock drama.

She intended to set aside a few million as sustenance for her adorable companions at home, while channeling the remainder into the material market for investment.

“Fifty million?” Scarry blinked, his mind struggling to process the revised figure.

Half of one hundred million? What a windfall!

‘Of course not! I’d still be paying fifty million for absolutely nothing!’ The reality hit him like a bolt of lightning.

Though fifty million was still a staggering amount, it was undoubtedly more manageable than one hundred million. Leroy exchanged a glance with Scarry, both of them silently acknowledging the unspoken compromise.

‘Let’s just pay it!’ With a few quick gestures, they agreed to split the penalty evenly, each contributing twenty-five million.

Once the confirmation text from Swire Bank arrived, Yaeger left the Entertainment Center with a bright, victorious smile.

“What a colossal loss! If I’d known this would happen, I would never have helped those two fools in the first place!” Scarry lamented bitterly, his sorrow evident.

“Ah, I suppose we’re just unlucky,” Leroy muttered, leaning back into the sofa with a deep, resigned sigh.

Even with the help of a supercomputer, he never could have foreseen Ronald’s sudden interference in this mess. For something so improbable to happen, wasn’t it fair to say they were cursed with terrible luck?

“What’s our next move?” Scarry asked, gesturing at the two unconscious figures sprawled on the floor like oversized dumplings.

“Book a direct flight and send them back to Jinxi Province,” Leroy said calmly, his gaze settling on Hank and Doug.

“Isn’t that ridiculously expensive?” Scarry grumbled, clearly reluctant. Having just lost twenty-five million, the thought of shelling out more for a private flight to send those fools home made him bristle with reluctance.

“If the trip takes too long and they die en route, we’ll be held responsible,” Leroy replied solemnly.

“That’s true,” Scarry admitted with a helpless sigh. If those men from Dragonbane Mountain died here or on the way home, the fallout would be catastrophic for them.

While Scarry busied himself arranging a private flight to send Hank and Doug cback to Jinxi Province, Yaeger had already returned to the bustling [City of Chaos].

“Master!” Little Blue exclaimed, leaping forward to wrap her arms around Yaeger’s neck. “How much did you make?” Naturally, her primary concern was their ration money.

“Master, Master!” Vera 17 and 18 chimed in from the other side, darting over to grab Yaeger’s hands, their heads tilted upward at an adorable 45-degree angle. Their actions radiated pure cuteness.

“I made quite a bit, but I can only spare five million for all of you,” Yaeger said with a smile.

“How much tasty food can we buy with five million?” Little Blue asked, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.

“Plenty!” Vera 17 and 18 chimed in unison, their better grasp of food prices giving them confidence. Their voices brimmed with uncontainable joy. After all, five million was a fortune to spend on food!

# **Chapter 621 – Happy Shopping, Pixie Reaches Level 10**

“Master, I want spicy crayfish, boiled cabbage, roast duck, wondrous stew, supreme prawns, heavenly shark fin, sweet and sour ribs, premium abalone, braised beef, cheese-baked lobster—ouch!”

Before Little Blue could finish her enthusiastic list, Yaeger flicked her forehead. “Stop! Are you trying to bankrupt me?”

Spicy crayfish and sweet and sour ribs were reasonable enough, but heavenly shark fin and premium abalone? The mere thought of their extravagant names sent shivers down Yaeger’s spine.

It wasn’t that Yaeger couldn’t afford fine dining, but with the voracious appetites of the three eaters at home, her bank account would be emptied in no time.

“Master, I want new clothes!” Vera 17 tugged at Yaeger’s skirt, her voice filled with anticipation.  
“Master, me too!” Vera 18 chimed in without missing a beat.  
“Master, me three!” Little Blue rushed over, her excitement evident. ‘I’m the boss of these two brats. There’s no way I’ll fall behind!’ she thought triumphantly.

“Fine, fine. I’ll buy it all,” Yaeger said with a wry smile. They had been talking about food just moments ago, yet the conversation had somehow shifted to clothing. These girls truly were a handful—but undeniably adorable.

“Oh yeah!” The three little ones immediately swarmed Yaeger, hugging her tightly and nuzzling their faces against her.

‘Sob, sob… I, the mighty [E-Fairy], have been reduced to acting cute just to get new clothes,’ Vera 17 and 18 lamented inwardly as they snuggled closer.

Though they had accepted Yaeger as their master, adapting to this new dynamic was still a challenge for them. Who could have imagined that the infamous [E-Fairy], a figure who once prowled the Internet, would have clones reduced to such a state?

It was pitiful, weak, and more than a little tragic.

“Alright, that’s enough. Stop rubbing!” Yaeger said, pulling them off her. She then turned to Little Blue. “Check if the nearby malls are still open. I need to do some shopping.”

By this hour, most stores were likely closed. Still, Yaeger wanted to double-check before heading out. Better safe than sorry—a principle Yaeger knew well and always adhered to.

After a quick check, Little Blue reported, “Most of them are closed. Master, do you want to go to the nearest one or the furthest?”

“The biggest one,” Yaeger replied decisively. In addition to buying clothes for the three, she intended to pick up kitchen supplies and food ingredients. Since smaller malls often lacked variety, the largest one was the obvious choice.

“Understood. Shall I teleport you there now, Master?” Little Blue asked, tapping the virtual screen.

“Yes, let’s go now. Make sure to bring back the larger appliances first; we can handle the smaller ones later,” Yaeger instructed.

“Understood. Teleportation commencing now,” Little Blue said as her eyes flickered with light. In the next instant, Yaeger vanished in a burst of white light.

Yaeger materialized in the middle of a dark, deserted mall.

“Infrared cameras? How annoying,” Yaeger muttered as her sharp eyes quickly spotted numerous surveillance devices. “Well, no matter. You’re taking the night off,” Standing on her tiptoes, Yaeger began disabling the infrared cameras with precise movements.

Within minutes, every camera in the shopping mall had been covered with thick cloth, rendering them completely ineffective. While destroying them outright would have been simpler, Yaeger opted for a gentler approach, mindful that she was here to shop, not cause unnecessary damage.

“It doesn’t look like they sell walk-in freezers here. I guess I’ll have to settle for a few large refrigerators,” Yaeger murmured, adjusting her expectations. After browsing through the electronics section, Yaeger confirmed there were no walk-in freezers in stock.

Upon further reflection, she realized it was unreasonable to expect a standard shopping mall to carry industrial-grade equipment like that.

“Bison and Higher. These two brands should do,” she decided after inspecting the available options. After jotting down the prices on her phone, Yaeger instructed Little Blue to teleport five large refrigerators back home.

With that many refrigerators, storing enough food to last several days wouldn’t be an issue. Making a food run every few days would be far less troublesome. At any rate, it was a significant improvement over buying food several times a day.

Besides, Yaeger had a feeling that her frequent shopping trips might eventually raise red flags with the stores. Even though she always paid in full without issue. Such unusual behavior was bound to attract unwanted attention sooner or later.

With the kitchen appliances taken care of, Yaeger moved on to shopping for food ingredients. This part was much simpler—she simply cleared entire shelves, dumping everything into her cart without hesitation.

‘It’s a blessing my little ones aren’t picky eaters,’ she thought, amused.

Before long, a small mountain of food ingredients had accumulated around her. Little Blue activated the teleportation sequence, causing the pile of groceries in front of Yaeger to vanish instantly.

“Next up, I need to pick out some cute clothes for them. Oh, and shoes too,” Yaeger reminded herself.

Yaeger typically found shopping to be a tedious waste of time, but when it came to picking out clothes for her little companions, she felt nothing but excitement. “Hehe, what style should I pick for them? Gothic? Kids’ costumes? Maybe uniforms? Forget it—I’ll just grab everything that looks cute!” she decided with a mischievous grin.

---

Meanwhile, within the game world…

“I finally reached Level 10. That was tougher than I expected,” Pixie sighed, standing in front of the teleportation formation with a look of relief. If her peers overheard her remark, they would surely be overcome with envy—or perhaps even cough up blood in frustration.

Reaching Level 10 in such a short time was a feat most players could only dream of. What more could she ask for? Of course, her rapid progression was thanks to Yaeger’s guidance—and the undeniable influence of money.

To Pixie, any problem that money could solve wasn’t a problem at all.

“Hehe, Princess, I’m on my way to see you!” Pixie’s expression shifted instantly, a bright smile lighting up her face. With a confident stride, she stepped into the teleportation formation.

A brilliant flash of white light engulfed her moments later as waves of spatial energy radiated outward.

“Huh? Wait a second. Didn’t Princess mention that someone with an overly powerful Bloodline might—” Before she could finish her thought, the teleportation process had already begun.

Some time earlier… In the Flame Dragon Empire, a blazing valley engulfed in roaring flames…

“Ahhh!” Rakshasa gripped a glowing crimson greatsword in both hands and swung it fiercely at the elegant woman in the red dress before her—Dragon Empress Hera.

The greatsword, powerful enough to cleave a boulder in two, unleashed a surge of crimson blade energy—but it didn’t even scratch Hera’s translucent barrier. The clash of metal reverberated through the fiery valley.

“That’s not enough. Your attack is too weak. Put your full strength into it,” Hera said, her tone calm and indifferent.

“Yes, Master!” Rakshasa replied with fervor, her respect for Hera clearly deepened since their last encounter. However, her voice still carried a slight awkwardness, as though unaccustomed to the word.

It was almost as if speaking was still unfamiliar to her.

“[Heavenly Dragon Flash]!” Rakshasa vanished mid-sentence, her figure dissolving into a blur.

As expected, Hera glanced upward to see Rakshasa reappear mid-air, her body engulfed in roaring flames, resembling a goddess of fire. Rakshasa poured all her strength into a rapid descent, the flames surrounding her forming a massive crimson dragon with its jaws wide open, ready to consume Hera.

“Your strength and speed are commendable, but your flame control still needs work. I’d give you ninety points…” Hera remarked, her voice measured. Before finishing her sentence, Hera’s expression darkened as she sensed something unusual. With a single gesture, she effortlessly dispersed the fiery dragon.

With a sweep of her aura, she pulled Rakshasa toward her in an instant.

“Master?” Rakshasa barely managed to steady herself before Hera seized her arm.

“Let’s go greet our new companion,” Hera said, a rare smile gracing her lips. Her expression radiated genuine joy.

Before Rakshasa could respond, the two vanished in a burst of red light infused with spatial energy.

# **Two as One Princesses Interlude 28 - Leshimiiya’s Troubles**

# **※Leshimiiya POV**

After getting caught in a monster stampede and being saved by a girl, I took steps to ensure that we would not act against her will or be perceived as doing so.  
Runya, who was there with me, seemed to doubt the necessity of this, but I imposed a strict gag order on everyone present. I intend to relay the truth of the matter to my father, the king, alone.  
Despite the gag order, Duke Hausen will undoubtedly need to be informed of the situation. As such, this incident will likely remain known only to the royal family and the House of Hausen.

Depending on my father’s and Duke Hausen’s judgment, it may end up becoming an open secret, but I would like to believe they won’t be foolish enough to let it reach that point.  
No, whether they act foolishly or not may very well depend on my discernment and explanation.  
The masked girl—she is most likely the same person my foolish brother disrespected. If so, I was unable to grasp the extent of her strength, and even Runya failed to extract any information about her.

If war were to break out between us, Ausente would undoubtedly sustain major damage.  
Even though it was on a small scale, she had the power to single-handedly quell a stampede.  
If she were to rampage in the capital, even if we managed to subdue her, the damage would be catastrophic.

We cannot easily send knights after a lone target, especially one who, despite being masked, unmistakably appears to be a child.  
The knights can only be mobilized when there is clear evidence of damage and her threat level has been confirmed.  
Even if we were to issue a royal decree to mobilize the knights, she is experienced in fighting multiple enemies and has a verified method of escaping.

We might be able to drive her away, but defeating her would be nearly impossible, and our relationship with Central would surely deteriorate upon her return home.

These are only hypothetical scenarios, but I believe it’s best to avoid provoking her while the possibility still remains.  
I will convey all of this to my father and leave the final decision to him. While he is the one to make the ultimate judgment, I can feel the weight of Ausente’s fate pressing down on my shoulders, and the pressure is nauseating.

I am currently in a private room meant for informal discussions with my father.  
Upon my return to the capital, I had relayed a message to inform that I had an urgent matter to discuss. The knights who escorted me have knowledge of the situation, so I believe everything should have gone smoothly.

However, as the king of a nation, my father has little idle time. He will come to meet me here as soon as he has a free moment.

While organizing my thoughts on how to narrate the events, the door opened, and I reflexively stood.

「Oh, Leshimiiya, I’m glad to see you back. Have you been well?」  
「Yes, fortunately, I was able to return without so much as a scratch.」  
「I’ve placed a heavy burden on your shoulders. If you find yourself in trouble, don’t hesitate to ask for my help.」

It’s been a while since we’ve seen each other, and I’m relieved to see my father in good health.  
As always, he expresses guilt over the burdens I bear and asks if I need anything at every opportunity.  
While my position has made me a target, I know my father works tirelessly to keep me safe, so I can’t help but feel reserved when making requests. However, this time, I intend to take full advantage of my position.

「Of course. Father, I’ve come today to make a request.」  
「I was told you had an urgent matter to discuss. Did something happen?」  
「Before that, I’d like you to grant me a certain request after I explain the situation.」  
「… I’ll consider it.」

As a king, I understand that my father can’t simply agree to every request.  
“I’ll consider it” is usually a polite way of expressing refusal, but for now, I’ll take these words at face value.

「On our way back to the capital, we were attacked by bandits who caused an artificial stampede.」  
「I see, that’s… no, tell me everything that happened first.」  
「Thank you very much. The stampede has already been resolved, but the issue lies with the one who quelled it.」  
「I see. While your escorts are exceptional, I imagine it would be difficult to keep you completely unscathed during a stampede. Were you rescued?」

Grateful for my father’s calm demeanor, I nodded and continued.

「We were saved by a black-haired girl wearing a mask with a dragon insignia.」  
「What?」

My father sounded as though he were on the verge of a headache.  
I can sympathize with his reaction—it’s utterly ridiculous.  
Frankly, I want to grumble about it myself. But our side has essentially shown discourtesy toward someone who extended us charity, so we have no right to complain.

「Right. In conclusion, the person who rescued me is likely the same girl who saved my brother.  
This is because, with a song, she redirected the incoming monsters towards her. Besides that, I was also rendered incapable of taking my eyes off her.」  
「Meaning there’s a possibility of her being a Song Princess. Still, that alone wouldn’t be enough to resolve a stampede, would it?」  
「Immediately after, she exterminated roughly 100 monsters all by herself.  
As such, I wouldn’t doubt it if she were an A-rank hunter; a high-level one, even. If you cannot believe my words, I wouldn’t mind if you confirmed it with the escorting knights as well.」  
「It’s not that I can’t believe it… but this is…」

I cannot blame Father for being at a loss for words.  
Moreover, despite quelling an entire stampede, she still seemed to have plenty of energy to spare. I don’t want to consider it, but perhaps she wasn’t even fighting at full strength.

The Ausente royal family has preemptively committed a disrespectful act against such an individual. It’s only natural to feel speechless.  
If she is indeed an A-rank hunter, my brother may be of a higher social standing, but that doesn’t mean he can act however he pleases.  
If the king were to needlessly make light of the leader of the knights, someone considered the strongest in the nation, that individual might defect to another country, weakening Ausente. While the king holds a higher social rank, it is necessary to make accommodations to keep such vital figures within our borders.

「Afterwards, she told me to make it so “nothing happened.”  
If you could grant my request, please ensure that the stampede incident is kept confidential.  
If it’s not possible, please keep any investigations about this matter discreet and hidden, so she doesn’t notice.」  
「… Are there others who know about this?」  
「Only the Hausen family, I believe.」  
「I see.」  
「Additionally, regarding this matter…」  
「I’ll make sure that this doesn’t reach Vilibart’s ears.」  
「Thank you very much.」

If this information reaches Brother Vilibart, he might act rashly again.  
While I have heard that he realized his mistake, apparently, he’s still adamant about being betrothed to the mysterious girl no matter what.  
Her strength, her grace—even I, as a fellow girl, couldn’t help but feel drawn to her.  
If I could see her dance—one different from the usual social dances—one more time; if I could hear her song—one unlike anything I’ve heard before—once again, I can’t help but imagine how much delight that could bring.

With my conversation with Father concluded—he mentioned that he would speak with the Hausen family as soon as possible—I was heading toward my long unoccupied bedroom when I ran into someone I would have preferred not to: Brother Vilibart.  
Like a predator spotting prey, he approached me the moment I entered his vision.

「Miiya, so you’re back.」  
「Yes, elder brother. I have returned.」  
「It must be nice to be you—so free, with no royal duties.  
Where did you go this time?」  
「To the Hausen territory.」  
「How carefree.」

You’re the reason I had to leave in the first place. But I’m not going to say that out loud.  
Brother Vilibart behaves this way because he dislikes me, so even if I said anything, he’d just dismiss me as being cheeky.  
Brother thinks of me as lazy and frivolous. He seems to believe the reason I have more free time and fewer assignments than our other siblings is simply that I’m pampered.

I previously exhausted my wits trying to dispel his misunderstanding, but due to my inadequate explanations and his own disposition, he never accepted my reasoning. From then on, he ignored any attempts I made to clarify.  
Brother Vilibart only pesters me like this when Father and our other brothers aren’t around, so perhaps actually has a vague understanding of my position.

「Come to think of it, you’ll be enrolling at the second academy, right?」  
「Yes, that is correct.」  
「Well, isn’t that the perfect place for you? Enjoy all the flattery over there.」

Leaving those words behind, Brother cackled as he walked away.  
He must be heading toward Father based on his direction, but will he even be given any attention?  
While this cynical thought crossed my frigid mind, I hurried back to my bedroom.

Despite his behavior, Brother Vilibart actually has a decent reputation amongst the people.  
This is because he uses his mobility as a fourth prince to assist citizens in a bid for popularity.  
Apparently, he loves being showered with praise, so he puts on quite a good front for the public.  
Rather, he reserves his oppressive behavior solely for me.

That’s just the way Brother Vilibart is. I don’t have any major issues with him at this point. While I wouldn’t be against seeing him blunder his way to ruin, something on that scale would likely negatively impact Ausente.  
As such, I’d prefer he continue his publicity stunts without further change.

---

Night passed, and it was now the day of the second academy entrance exam.  
Generally, everyone is eligible to take the exam and receives equal treatment. However, as a member of the royal family, I alone am given special treatment.  
After all, with my position, my presence at the examination venue could cause a ruckus. Unlike the first academy, the second academy crams its entire entrance exam into a single day. Due to that, the academy would also prefer to avoid anything that may cause needless delays.

I took the written exam in a room specifically dedicated to the royal family, and shortly after I finished, Runya arrived.

Runya flung the door open vigorously, and upon seeing me, she yelled, “Lady Mii!!” and ran toward me in a very flustered state.  
This was unthinkable behavior from her usual self, so instead of admonishing her, I urged her to explain.

「What’s wrong?」  
「There’s another one.」  
「Another one?」  
「Another one who I can’t read with my appraisal!」

Unable to read with her appraisal… The masked girl was also able to block her appraisal.  
It’s not necessarily an act impossible to achieve, but the number of those capable of such a feat is very limited. Sorceric items that can invalidate appraisal are rare and extremely expensive. Simply possessing one indicates either a prestigious lineage or a significant position in the underworld.  
Whichever it is, I should have already received information if such an individual intended to enroll in Ausente’s academic institution.

Appraisal obstruction can also be achieved through sorcery. However, only highly skilled sorcerers are capable of fending off Runya’s appraisal.  
Her capability is of the extent that she can typically extract information even from sorcerers of A-rank level as long as they do not actively prepare countermeasures against it.  
And people of that caliber don’t appear so frequently.

「What sort of individual was it?」  
「She was a small girl. Her most eye-catching characteristics were her long white hair and blue eyes.」  
「So she doesn’t have black hair… Wait, white hair and blue eyes…!?」

That means it wasn’t the masked girl. No, in hindsight, it felt as though the masked girl was deliberately drawing attention to her black hair.  
It was as if she wanted that specific trait to stand out. This is mere speculation for now, but I’ll keep it in mind.  
More importantly, I cannot ignore the fact that this girl has white hair and blue eyes.

While this combination is rare, it’s not entirely unheard of.  
That’s why the probability of what I’m thinking is low. However, I cannot disregard the fact that this girl matches the description of the recently adopted daughter of Mistress Fiiyanamia.  
The news of Mistress Fiiyanamia’s daughter has yet to reach Ausente, which is likely why Runya doesn’t seem to realize the potential connection.

I can’t help but feel a bit envious of her. Because had I not made the connection myself, I wouldn’t be feeling this tightening knot in the pit of my stomach right now.  
Regardless, investigating this girl is likely necessary. It would have been ideal to consult Father for guidance, but there’s no time right now.

「I understand, Runya. I’ll handle the rest, so would you mind waiting for further instructions?  
We’re still in the middle of the exam, after all. Prioritize that first and foremost.」  
「I understand. Princess, please take care.」

After watching Runya leave the room, I summoned my attendant.  
I instructed them to gather information about the girl in question. Even if all they can retrieve are the details from her admissions documents and her test results, it’s still better than having no information at all.  
Now the only task remaining is to find a way to make contact with her.

# **Levelmaker Chapter 353 - About Rir (Shuu)**

“Hey Kanata. That woman, Kyrian, is takin’ her partner to the med bay and people are spreadin’ word ’bout the Black Gods appearance in and around the castle… What else can we do?” I asked Kanta, after Rir had her fill of head pats.

It was currently just us in here.

“True enough. We might be able to fix the spear… Sakura, is it possible?”  
“Hm~, I think it is!”

Come to think of it, Sakura’s magic can also restore things. Guess that’s one problem solved. That whole evil god business was over a bit too quickly.

Kanata and Sakura left to repair Gungnir. In here, we sages still couldn’t use magic.  
Now it was just Rir, I, and the frozen king in this room.

“Woof, woof, that was over surprisingly fast!”  
“Right, all thanks to your hard work, Rir! I didn’t do a damn thing…”  
“You’re wrong. You gave instructions to all those people, didn’t you?”

We sat down where we stood and gazed at the king trapped in ice.

…Although we’ll thaw him out later, we did cut off his arm, so I doubt he’ll just obediently send us back to Japan. Well, no point worryin’ ’bout that now. The power of skills is crazy, so we might manage to get home, if we brainwash him with Illusion Magic. Though us sages can’t do that, so we’ll have to rely on someone else, like Rir.

Once this is over, we’ll go home.  
…Will I be goin’ home?

Come to think of it, while it did feel long, it only has been a short time since I came here. Somewhere between one… and two months, that’s how much time I’ve spent in this world.

Well, it was a series of shocking events, right? Impossible stuff, like a ball of fire coming from my hands.

There’s a lot to consider, but the most important part is ’bout Rir, after all. What do I do with her? Like I thought this mornin’, can’t there be some way to take her with me to Earth or to come and go between there and here? Even if we went back over there, we’ll keep our skills, so Kanata might be able to teleport between Earth and Anazumu… and take me with him.

…I’m positive it won’t take long for me to want to see her again. There’ll be longing, terrible awful longing.

Some time ago, I was talking to Mika… scolding her. After that idiot got himself killed, Mika became weird. Well, she started acting and talking strangely, it was terrible. Pretending Ayumu was still alive.

I feel like words don’t do it justice… all I can say is, she became weird.

She locked herself in her room and ate barely anything, at least that was what Sakura told me. I got worried about Mika and visited her at home, and then went there to talk to her every day for about five days. Maybe since Sakura, her mom and dad, and I finally got through to her, Mika’s mood gradually improved. I thought that was a good thing, but…

…Well, at any rate, I was the one lecturin’ Mika, but now I can’t say a thing, y’know. Maybe that’s what it means to love someone. Right now… I feel like I understand Mika’s feelings a bit better.

“Woof~, Shuu, you’re looking so serious,” Rir commented as she peered at my face.

Her eyes were opened widely, and she looked at me in apparent worry. It was rather adorable.

“Ah, well, the Black God is still here… Even though we made him powerless, we can’t be careless now…”  
“Yeah, you’re right.”

She stared at the evil god. As she did that, I hugged her tightly from behind.

“Woof~? Our friends Kanata and Sakura are working hard to fix the spear right now, so this isn’t the time, you know.”  
“Ah, right, my bad… I just…”

I let go of her.

Hang on, when did Rir get so close with those two[1](https://re-library.com/translations/levelmaker/volume-13/chapter-353-about-rir-shuu/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-93907)? Well, I’m sure it’s fine.

It sounded like someone was coming, so I turned my head. On the other side of the open door to the throne room, I could see Kanata and Sakura, who’d likely immediately finished their repairs.

“Shuu, we fixed it!” Kanata exclaimed with a smile, holding Gungnir, which looked prettier than before, in his hand.  
“Oh! Then we’ll first-”

I was trying to get up to meet the boy, when my vision flickered.  
The hell? Am I gettin’ lightheaded? I thought I was doin’ enough trainin’ to avoid that kinda stuff, but… maybe I’m just tired?

“Sorry, just got a bit dizzy…” I explained to Kanata and Sakura who were looking at me in silence.

Sure enough, this is the first time in my life I got lightheaded, but that ain’t no reason to be that shocked, right?

“Ah… Sh-Shuu… b-behind… you…” Kanata stammered.

What’s behind me…? Did that damn king manage to get out of the ice?

I turned my head to check. The king was still on ice, as he should be. However, I couldn’t see Rir where she was previously.  
Come to think of it, I just saw something off in my field of vision… was it at my feet? Oh…

---

**TL notes:**  
Some more musings and self-reflection about Shuu’s possible future with or without Rir, and a rather ominous end. What did Kanata and Sakura see that Shuu still hasn’t noticed?

In other news, when reading ahead, I came across an instance of Rir’s name being written in roman letters and turns out it’s supposed to be “Lil”. Fu̲ck me, I guess?  
Now, you could argue this is on me, since I never checked for roman writings of her name in the novel, but the author never used roman letters except for game terms, mainly in stat screens, up to this point, so I didn’t expect them to exist in the first place. Same as with the Shuu/Shou mix-up, I’d prefer not to change everything at this point, especially with the current name being a reference to Fenrir, but feel free to comment if you think it should be changed.

#### **Footnotes:**

1. In the original, he comments that Rir started to call Sakura “Sakura-chan”, something that isn’t reflected in my translation, since I usually don’t localize that suffix.

# **Chapter 354 – What Used to be a Wolf Girl (Kanata, Sakura & Shuu)**

“It got fixed in an instant…!”  
“Eh-heh-heh!”

Less than a kilometer from the castle, the two kids had repaired Gungnir. It took barely any time at all for Sakura’s magic to fix the spear.

“Then, shall we head back?”  
“Yeah.”

They teleported up to the point where their skills were just barely usable, and then hurried back to the castle.

_With this, it should be over_, they thought.

“Shuu, we fixed it!” Kanata relayed to Shuu, when they reached the throne room and could see him straight ahead.  
“Oh! Then we’ll first-”

The moment Shuu and Rir were about to get up, a dazzling flash of light raced through the room.

“Sorry, just got a bit dizzy…” Shuu commented, as he staggered onto his feet.

At his feet, where nothing was before, now something had appeared, while the person who’d been next to him, was gone.

There were a lot of things. The clothes, bag, and bracelet of the wolf girl, who’d told them she’d been saved by Shuu, plus a large amount of ash were scattered at Shuu’s feet.

Both kids were smart, so they could immediately guess what this was. It was, or rather, it used to be Rir.

They couldn’t find the words. Shuu seemed to grow suspicious about the way they looked at him, but he hadn’t noticed the ashes.

“Ah… Sh-Shuu… b-behind… you…” Kanata squeezed out in a trembling voice.

Just as Kanata had told him, Shuu checked what was behind him, but only verified that the evil god was still there. However, when he turned his gaze back at Kanata and Sakura, he noticed.

“Huh…?

That was all Shuu managed dumbfoundedly. The situation was incomprehensible to him. After looking at the ashes and clothes for a while, he inclined his head.

“Hey, Kanata, Sakura. What’s this stuff…?”

He looked at them with empty eyes. His face told them he didn’t want to believe it.

“T-That’s… uhm…”

The kids still couldn’t find the words. Kanata’s mind had frozen up.

“This is… Rir’s underwear… her bag… the bracelet we found in the dungeon… what’s goin’ on? That’s… ash, right? How… and why would she take off all her clothes and leave behind ash? My messages to her won’t connect… Is she wanderin’ around naked? Why’d she do that…?”

He picked up a handful of the sand-like ash and let it fall to the ground again. He then looked at Kanata and Sakura again.

“…? What’s goin’ on, what is-”

It happened when he said that.

There was a sudden gust. It picked up everything that used to be Rir, except for the ashes Shuu was still holding, her clothes, bag, and bracelet, and soon turned into a whirlwind. With Kanata and Sakura unable to do anything, seeing they still couldn’t use any magic, said whirlwind tore a large hole into the wall and escaped outside.

No one knew where it was headed. Or rather, they had no way to know.

“Hah… this ice is friggin’ cold.”

They could hear a voice from the throne.

The sages, except for Shuu, turned there. The ice that should have been imprisoning Loukis, was gradually melting. Even more, the spear made of mithril had also started to melt.

A short while later, Loukis emerged from the ice, as if nothing had ever happened. He picked up the arm lying next to him, and when he pushed it against the part where it had been cut off, it immediately reattached itself. It looked like his other wounds all had healed, too.

Loukis, or rather, Surtr grinned, and then started to talk in an unpleasant voice, that seemed intended to enrage the listeners.

“Huh, oh my!? Aren’t we missing someone? **I** wonder, did something happen while **I** was in that block of ice?”

Surtr started walking towards Shuu. However, the latter just kept looking outside where the ashes had disappeared, and didn’t display any reaction. Kanata’s mind had frozen up, mainly due to the loss of Rir and Surtr’s sudden activity.

“…No reply? Well, not a big deal, right? Just some smelly beastfolk slave who got turned into ashes and blown away with the wind, right? Not something to worry about, right?”

He finally reached Shuu, sat down next to him, and continued talking while looking in the same direction. Shuu was still in a daze and didn’t seem like he’d pay any attention to his surroundings.

“Oh, by the way. That dimwit Loukis has a skill called ‘Limited Instant Death’. If you gather a certain amount of magic power over several days, you can kill anyone you like. Though it can only be used once per year, you see. So, **I** put **MY** abilities to good use and strengthened it! Surprise, surprise, **I** made it so whoever is killed is turned into ashes!”

Surtr brought his face close to Shuu’s without hesitation and met the latter’s eyes. The Black God grinned broadly. His mouth warped the most it had up to this point.

“By the way, no matter what you try, you can’t bring her back to life! Even the sages’ Restoration Magic is meaningless! To begin with, with the amount of ash you have, you can’t do anything, Master Shuu! …Well, she was just a slave anyway, wasn’t she? Or a former slave, doesn’t matter. Not a big issue, right? Right?”

He understood. Shuu knew that this had been Rir.

“R-Rir… You… ba̲stard…!”

Surtr’s words broke something within Shuu, and together with a snapping sound, he grabbed the Black God at his collar and was about to strike him-

---

**TL notes:**  
And everything goes to shi̲t. When you look back at chapters 350 to 354, it becomes clear that Surtr was putting on an act with the singular goal of sending Shuu, his main target for possession, into a rage. It also shows just how extensive Dace’s future knowledge must be, for her to plan it to this extent.

---

# **Chapter 355 – Complete Possession (Kanata & Sakura)**

“AAAAAAAAAAH!!! YOU Fu̲CKING ASSHOOOOOOOLE!!”

Shuu was about to swing his arm with all his strength, intending to strike Loukis’… no, Surtr’s face with a punch containing all his rage. Originally, Shuu’s power was one of righteousness, but on top of having his girlfriend killed, with whom he had laughed together just earlier, he had been mocked.

He was the most enraged he had ever been in his life. Thus, he was about to strike. However, his arm stopped.

“Hah… hah… GHAAAAAAAAAAH!”

…Rage. Rage hotter than hell itself was laid bare, and Shuu, who thought his hand had been stopped by something he missed, tried to strike again, only to find his body not heeding his commands.

Sakura, on the other hand, froze in fear as she noticed something different. Shuu, too, saw it, and the shock made him come to his senses just a little. The same black haze that had been emitted from Gungnir, now came from Loukis’ mouth. It then invaded Shuu’s body.

“-the Hell… this is…!”

Even with his resentment of Surtr, Shuu got a clear feeling of “danger” and tried to take some distance, but in the end, he was unable to put up any resistance. Sakura, who saw it from afar and got a bad premonition, left Kanata, who was still rigid, for now and readied her weapon. Then, she engaged the sword’s auto-control and sent it towards Surtr.

_“Stay out of **MY** way!”_

The Black God’s voice came from seemingly out of nowhere. Sakura knew for sure that Loukis hadn’t spoken. When the sword was just about to reach the King, Shuu, for some reason, grabbed its hilt and stopped it.

“!?”

Shuu himself was the most shocked one by this. He hadn’t consciously moved his body. Still, even this shock was only reflected in his expression.

_“Take it all in, insect. Watch and see!”_  
“S-Stop it, you damn-”

The speed at which the haze entered Shuu’s body increased. Shuu started to panic, but he still couldn’t put up any resistance.

“Sakura, get clear!”

The moment she heard that voice, a spear was thrown from behind her. It flew at a speed that made it impossible to grab and scored a direct hit on Loukis’ body. The king’s body was blown away by the impact, which had much more force than you’d expect from a mere spear pierce. The spear then stuck itself deep into the wall without opening a hole.

Kanata, who had quickly recovered from his mental freeze, had thrown it and was now glaring at the king’s body, who had been flung away. Said body didn’t react in any way.

Sakura’s bad premonition had been spot-on. The magic power she had felt from the king had now moved to Shuu[1](https://re-library.com/translations/levelmaker/volume-13/chapter-355-complete-possession-kanata-sakura/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-93988).

“Gah… curses… well, no matter, **I** don’t need that body any longer.”

Those words had come from Shuu’s mouth. He no longer looked shocked. As for the reason…

“Right, **I**‘d say that’s a complete possession.”

The black haze had fully entered Shuu’s body. Finally, he stood up.

“Alright. Thanks to that overwhelmingly strong rage, **I** was able to get in smoothly. Guess **I** owe my thanks to that Rir girl.”

Shuu… or rather, the being that had taken over his body, cracked his joints.

“…Yo, Kanata, Sakura,” he said, walking towards Kanata and Sakura in the friendliest manner, even though it was Surtr inside.

Practically out of a conditioned reflex, Kanata stood in front of Sakura, hiding her behind his back.

“C’mon, don’t look at me like there’s somethin’ wrong! It’s me, Shuu!”

No one believed those words. Shuu was grinning, with the corners of his mouth pulled up as far as Loukis’ earlier, and his teeth bared. The two kids had never seen their friend make such a horror inducing expression.

“‘Course you don’t believe me… After all, it’s **ME**, the Black God Surtr, right…? Gah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha[2](https://re-library.com/translations/levelmaker/volume-13/chapter-355-complete-possession-kanata-sakura/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-93988)!!!”

Still in Shuu’s appearance, the Black God broke into roaring laughter.

“…Oh, right, you guys can use your skills again, now,” Surtr added, as if he had just remembered it. “You’re not gonna use them? You can finally utilize them again, you know? …More importantly, listen to this. This body is the best **I** ever had! The greatest part is that almost all his skills are fire-based, it’s perfect! The body is well trained and then there’s this magic sword… This is awesome! …Right?”

After patting down Shuu’s entire body, Surtr shrugged his shoulders, as if to say, “good grief”.

---

**TL notes:**  
Surtr now has a body practically tailor-made for him, but it’s still two versus one, so Kanata and Sakura might stand a chance. If they manage to attack their friend’s body, that is.

# **Chapter 356 – The Sages and the Black God (Kanata & Sakura)**

“Now… guess **I**‘ll start by destroying this country. Or rather, let’s start with that fool.”

In spite of the Sages being present, Surtr calmly let his gaze wander through the throne room, until it came to rest on the impaled king.

“Although he did die the moment, **I** possessed him… healing magic is a scary thing, so just for the sake of caution.”

He snapped his fingers, and a moment later the king’s body was engulfed in flames. Normally, magic fired off by the sages would’ve been ineffective against Loukis, but due to him already being dead, it went off without any issues.

The fire enveloped his whole body instantly, giving Kanata and Sakura no chance to extinguish it, and the king, including the black spear, vanished, leaving not even ash behind. All that remained were a couple of accessories.

“This should do it. **I** should probably also destroy that Mephi-… Mephi-… that family whom that strumpet[1](https://re-library.com/translations/levelmaker/volume-13/chapter-356-the-sages-and-the-black-god-kanata-sakura/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-93993), Samaeyl, failed to eradicate. Once that’s done, **I**‘ll destroy everything that’s left!”

Surtr kept on monologuing. Meanwhile, Kanata and Sakura discussed things via messages.

[What… what do we do… Shuu… and Rir are…!]　  
[Mr. Loukis, too… If he’s in this state, you can’t bring him back to life, right?]　  
[Y-Yeah.]

Kanata kept thinking. With Loukis resurrection impossible, there was a high chance they’d never get to go home. But more importantly, they had to do something about the current situation first, or they might not even make it out alive themselves.

[It looks like… we can use magic again. If we seal the Black God, Shuu’s body should be left behind, so we’ll need to bring him back to life, then…]　  
[Can’t you send him into space…?]　  
[I don’t think so. Can we do anything about Rir?]

At that question, Sakura shook her head.

[Impossible, it won’t work…]　  
[…I see.]

Kanata shot a glance at Surtr.

“-but once **I**‘ve destroyed this country, the next, and whatever comes after that, what’ll **I** do then-”

He was still happily continuing his monologue. Kanata started exchanging messages with Sakura again.

[Sakura… unfortunately, we’ll have to leave Rir for later. If we don’t, we might die here, too.]　  
[…! Y-Yeah…]

Sakura rubbed the tears from her eyes.

[First, let’s study our foe… The powers of the Black God are possession and strengthening of his host’s original abilities. Finally, he mentioned something about Fire Magic.]　  
[…Right.]　  
[All the spears I had were melted down… so I’ll need to attack with a spear summoned by magic. Even that national treasure grade spear was destroyed, so in the worst case, I’m afraid even Gungnir might not make it… I’ll create a skill here and now.]

Kanata stealthily took out some magic cores from his bag and hurriedly got to work, synthesizing a spear summon skill. While observing what Surtr was doing, he created an appropriate darkness elemental spear summoning (SS-Rank) skill.

[This should do for now…]

As he sent that message, Surtr glared at the boy. Kanata noticed the gaze and turned his attention to the Black God.

“…Hey, are you guys done talking tactics? It’s surprisingly hard to just keep on monologuing, you know[2](https://re-library.com/translations/levelmaker/volume-13/chapter-356-the-sages-and-the-black-god-kanata-sakura/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-93993)?”  
“N-No, we still need some time…”  
“Get a move on!”

Kanata, who now understood that Surtr hadn’t continued his monologue not out of excitement, but to intentionally give the kids time to plan their strategy, hurriedly got to work.

[Not good… If you ask me what we should do… bringing us to an uninhabited island, fighting the Black God there until he’s weakened, and then sealing him… that’s all I’m coming up with.]　  
[You’re… you’re right…!]

It was far from what you could call a perfect plan, merely the rather obvious “fight in a safe place”. With more time, they might’ve come up with a better idea. However, right now, nothing else came to them.

[Then… could you buff us with as much support magic as possible?]　  
[Alright.]

Just as he had asked her to, Sakura cast the full gamut of support magic and restoration magic that healed over time on Kanata and herself.

“…We’re done now, Black God Surtr,” Kanata declared, after Sakura had signaled that she was done casting.

Surtr grinned at them, pulling the corners of his mouth up as far as was humanly possible.

“Okay, okay~, then let’s have our fight to the death! Here and-”  
“Unfortunately, it won’t be here.”

Kanata took a step forward while holding Sakura’s hand.

“Oh-ho…? You’re gonna teleport us to a place without any humans? **I** don’t mind that at all, you know?”  
“You got it… then, let’s go.”

Kanata gripped Sakura’s hand more tightly and invoked his teleportation…  
…skillfully moving just Surtr and himself, leaving the girl behind[3](https://re-library.com/translations/levelmaker/volume-13/chapter-356-the-sages-and-the-black-god-kanata-sakura/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-93993).

“…Wha-?”

Sakura, who had always assumed they would go together, was stunned. In that state, she received a message from her boyfriend.

[…I’ll see you later. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to put you in any danger. Please tell the people in the castle about the current situation, will you? I’ll make sure to bring back Shuu, so once I do… let’s go eat sweets… alright?]　  
[Wha-… hang on… Kanata-]

Before she managed to finish her reply, the connection was cut off.

---

**TL notes:**  
And we’re finally caught up to the information from Alim’s chapters at the end of volume 12. I’m not sure how Kanata expects to defeat a heavily buffed Shuu by himself, but I’m sure he has some plan. He is supposed to be very smart, after all.

# **Chapter 357 – Present Situation (Sakura)**

“What happened, Sakura?” Kyrian exclaimed, as she rushed up to the girl.

Behind her was a crowd of soldiers and several of the kingdom’s higher officials.

“Miss… Kyrian…”

Sakura turned her head to look at the woman, seemingly about to burst into tears at any moment.

Kyrian and the others had come here after hearing laughter and the sound of explosions from the throne room, but the current situation was so far out of their expectations, it left them baffled. There was a large hole in the wall, and the throne was drenched in water from the melted ice. The room was a mess, as if a storm had passed through, and there was ash scattered here and there. And most importantly, several people who should’ve been here were nowhere to be seen.

The higher officials and Kyrian had learned from the argument between Kanata, Dace, and Loukis about the latter’s plan to use the Black God, regardless of the danger this would pose to the country. This exactly had been Kanata’s goal, and when Dace suddenly summoned the Black God and then disappeared, it turned into unshakeable truth in their minds.

As a result, everyone in the castle already knew that Dace was no longer here. They also knew the Black God was possessing Loukis, so they had prepared to oppose him. They further knew that four people – Kanata, Shuu, Sakura, and Rir – were facing off with him. However, presently, it was just Sakura sitting in the middle of the throne room, all on her lonesome.

“S-Say, Sakura?”  
“…Uh… yes?”  
“What… happened?”

While the shock of being left behind by her boyfriend still remained, Sakura decided to follow the boy’s request and inform everyone about what happened.

“To begin with-”

Sakura started her explanation from scratch, seeing some of the people present hadn’t been given the information Kyrian and the higher officials already had.

How Kanata had exposed Loukis’ intrigue. How Dace broke Gungnir and disappeared after setting the Black God loose on them. How the Black God had possessed Loukis. How Rir made him temporarily powerless with Ice Magic. How said method of rendering him powerless proved ineffective, and how he had killed Rir in a manner which made resurrection impossible.

From that point on, Sakura’s explanation diverged from the truth. She quickly modified the chain of events in a way, so the Black God killed Loukis without leaving a trace before possessing Shuu. She feared that, should they succeed in subjugating the Black God, Shuu might be charged with Loukis’ murder. Consequently, she decided to tell them that Shuu’s possession happened only after Loukis’ death.

It brought Sakura considerable relief, when she heard the officials, who had been urged by Shuu to flee after the Black God’s appearance, exchange comments like “The king brought this on himself” during her telling of Loukis’ death.

Shortly after, Sakura brought her explanation to a close with the possessed Shuu and Kanata leaving her behind to fight in some uninhabited place.

“In other words, Sage Kanata is fighting the black god right now to separate him from Sage Shuu and seal him… did I get that right?”  
“…Yes.”

Sakura nodded at Kyrian’s question.

“Then… there’s… nothing we – the army – can do… is there?” Kyrian wondered, posing that question to the higher officials, too.

They merely nodded.

“In that case, Sakura, we can but wait for Kanata and Shuu… You needn’t worry, I’m sure your boyfriend will find a way.”  
“…You’re right!” Sakura agreed and walked up to the woman.

The soldiers who rushed here could only put their faith in Kanata, but they still returned to their posts, so they could sortie at any time, should the worst happen. The higher officials likewise prepared to communicate the crucial situation to the populace and their neighboring nations.

A single servant among them contacted another country.

[Your Majesty, Your Majesty! I am contacting you due to an emergency.]　  
[…Right now, we[1](https://re-library.com/translations/levelmaker/volume-13/chapter-357-present-situation-sakura/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-94028) are having tea with our lovely wife… what is it? Seeing you contacted us directly via message, something crucial must have happened. Are they finally making their move?]　  
[N-No, Your Majesty, they-]

The servant, no, the Mephilad Kingdom’s informant relayed the particulars, including the story he had heard from Sakura, to King Mephilad via messages.

[The Black God… has come back to life?]　  
[Indeed, that’s how it seems. There were numerous eyewitnesses, so I don’t think it’s false information.]　  
[It would be an issue, if he came to our country… in which case, only that girl might be left.]

The servant got curious about “that girl” the king had mentioned, so he asked for details.

[Who do you mean by… that girl, Your Majesty?]　  
[Alim Nariwei, you likely heard of her. She is truly incredible, you see! She could probably destroy that Black God in a flash… We believe what you told us is the truth. From now on, we will need to take various measures.]

---

**TL notes:**  
And now we know how the king found out so fast. Although, when you compare it with the events in chapter 341 to 343, it would seem the author forgot that the king was only informed about Surtr’s resurrection at first, and the events leading to Loukis’ death a bit later. So, the informant should’ve contacted him right after the events of chapter 350 and then again now, but it sounds like this was his first direct message.

#### **Footnotes:**

1. The king uses the 我 (ware) personal pronoun here, so I’m having him use the majestic plural. Usually, he either uses わし (pronoun for old people) or 俺 (when in adventurer mode)

# **Chapter 358 – Castle Yggdrasil**

Mika and I had finally arrived at the gates of Castle Yggdrasil. We were currently world-known top idols, so ever since the moment we entered the castle town, we had disguised ourselves.

Up to this point, I had never gone to any towns or cities other than Pipi Village and Mephilad’s royal capital[1](https://re-library.com/translations/levelmaker/volume-13/chapter-358-castle-yggdrasil/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-94035), so just on the way from the entrance of the city up to this point, we had seen various interesting sights.  
_I’d like to go here on a date with Mika and look at it calmly at some point._

“…Huh, what do you brats want? We really don’t have the time to deal with some kids now, so do us a favor and get lost!” one of the gate guards yelled at us.

The other three guards also sported looks of annoyance.

_For the time being, we need to tell them we’re here for important business, or we won’t be getting anywhere._

“Erm, we were asked by the king of Mephilad to come here…”  
“…What!? Are you making fun of us?”

That was the response we received, but then the apparently oldest among the guards came our way and called out to us.

“…Young ladies, did you come here to inform us about reinforcements from the Mephilad Kingdom? If you did, that would’ve been abnormally quick…”

_I see, the king must’ve contacted someone in this country while we were on route, and told them about sending reinforcements to oppose the Black God. This guard probably thinks we’re messengers carrying information concerning that. Normally, it would take several days by horse carriage from Mephilad to this country, so even if we were messengers, this would be rather quick._

_But well, we aren’t here to deliver messages._

I wordlessly shook my head.

“…Then, what is this about?”  
“We are the reinforcements! We can tell you the details once we’re inside.”  
“Ha-ha-ha-ha! What are you kids talking about? To begin with-”

With a sideways glance at the guard who was laughing at us, we silently handed over our guild cards to the senior guard. The expressions of the senior and the laughing guard stiffened, once they looked at those.

“Oh… e-e-erm, c-c-c-could you let us see your normal faces for the time being…?”  
“Of course. It might cause a commotion, so would it be alright if we only show them for a moment? Once we’re inside the castle, we will drop the disguise.”

Together with Mika, I turned off my disguise item and flashed a smile at the guards. Then I immediately turned it on again again.

“U-U-U-Understood! Please come on in!”  
“Thank you very much! …Two SSS-Rankers should have sufficient military strength, right?”  
“Y-Y-Y-Yes! Indeed, it is as you say!”  
“Oh~… so cute… Please forgive my earlier rudeness.”

Once we had passed through the gate, we dropped our disguises completely and quickly entered the castle. There was a mad rush in there.  
_That’s only to be expected, there’s some evil god out and about, after all._

_I can only speak for myself, but… normally at this point it wouldn’t be weird if some crowd gathered, but they’re only giving us some sideway glances and… Ah, no, those busy-looking people keep gawking at us, until they’re out of sight._

“We have been awaiting you, Lady Alim Nariwei, Lady Mika Magarigi. We have already been informed. Please allow me to be your guide.”

A man who could be described as an elderly gentleman, and who didn’t seem nervous at all, came to us. At this point Mika likely though of something, so she beckoned the old man to her and whispered something into his ear. He opened his eyes widely for an instant, before immediately regaining his composure and taking some distance from her.

“It is just as you say…” he commented. “Although I cannot talk about it much.”

[What did you talk to him about?] I asked her by message.  
[My female intuition told me that he might be the king’s spy, so I asked him in a roundabout way! Like, if he might be someone from my hometown. And looks like I hit the mark.]　  
[I see.]

_Female intuition can be convenient when it’s spot on. Well, Mika has good instincts, so they’re useful in situations like this._

“…Moving on to the main topic. We would like to give you more details about the events that transpired, so if you could come with me.”

The gentleman spy asked us to follow him and started walking. We stayed behind him. Some time later, we finally arrived in front of a room.

“One of the sages is waiting inside. You can inquire about the chain of events directly from her,” the man told us with a bow, knocked on the door, and then called out to the person in the room. “My Lady Sage, the reinforcements from the Mephilad Kingdom have arrived, so might you explain the particulars to them?”

From the other side of the door, I could hear a voice I knew very well reply in the affirmative. When Mika heard it, she gripped my hand strongly.

“I shall open the door then… please go on in.”

After the old man had opened the door for us, Mika and I entered.

In the room, which contained no unusual furniture, other than the large double bed, which gave off a somewhat adult atmosphere, I could see a familiar girl with black eyes and black hair tied up in pigtails, sitting on the sofa.

…Though describing her that way was far too roundabout. In other words, it was Sakura.

---

**TL notes:**  
Back to Alim and Mika who are about to reunite with someone from Earth. Will Sakura recognize her older sister in that form?

It’s kinda funny how Alim and Mika’s popularity has grown so much, they can no longer walk around without a disguise, so they start encountering situations again where they’re turned away on the merit of being random kids.

# **Boundary Labyrinth and the Foreign Magician. C131 Part1 - Interlude: Majin's Castle**

In front of the vortex of miasma that continued to drip inexhaustibly, a devastating tone finally sounded.

A large vertical crack appears in the trunk of the giant tree. At that... Valros looked at it indifferently and without any emotion. The miasma that had filled the cemetery quickly subsided. This is because Valros himself stopped the release.

“Finally?”

Releasing the seal of the sacred garden. The way to do this is to feed the sacred tree with plenty of nutrients, fatten it up, and let all the roots rot. A sacred tree that has absorbed the miasma to its limit will bear fruit and wither at the end of its life. However, if we don't follow the steps stipulated in the contract, these decayed sacred trees will be rebuilt in no time.

Valros jumped into the cave peeking through the crack in the trunk of a sacred tree that had rotted and produced fruit, and after a while, he returned to find a jewel that emitted miasma in his hand.

Without giving a second thought, I left the cemetery that had been my home for a long time.

Walk through the corridor lined with pillars. There was the Royal Castle of Belliondora, which was supposed to have been abandoned... but it was being rebuilt. The collapsed walls have been rebuilt, and the interior has been brought in from somewhere.

It was necessary to move the base here in order to collect the four jewels from the sacred gardens placed throughout Belliondora.

Due to their appearance and nature, some demons prefer the human lifestyle. Gardinis is a representative example of this. Therefore, Gardinis was probably the one who brought in these kinds of furniture.

However, Valros frowned, thinking that it was a little too much. He laid out a red carpet and decorated the walls with paintings... It was as if he were recreating the royal castle of Belliondora from the past. They say it's art, and if they don't imitate humans, they'll get bored to death.

I walked down the hallway... and entered the large hall, where lower-class demons were gathered. A man's screams of agony can be heard from beyond the crowd.

...There used to be grave robbers who came to Belliondora in search of treasure. He called himself an adventurer, but...he didn't have the adventurer plate, and there were reports of him being attacked from the other side. In reality, they are probably closer to a group of thieves.

However, no matter what their backgrounds are, if the demons were seen using Belliondora as their stronghold, they would not be able to let them go home alive.

That said, that's it. He is a demon who lives by feeding on the emotions of other creatures. Predation targets can be ordinary animals, but humans' negative emotions are in a different league. For them, it is a taste of bliss that cannot be replaced by anything else.

Therefore, it was very convenient for them to be rootless. It can be called a misfortune for them and a good fortune for the devils. No one would care if they were gone. That's why all of them were captured alive.

And so, they are captured alive and eaten as a supper.

I don't know what he's doing on the other side of the crowd, but along with his screams pleading for him to kill me, a feeling that fills Valros's hunger flows in.

The man's wishes go unheard. He neither lets him live nor kills him. When my spirit finally breaks down, I throw it away and move on to the next thing.

It's like raising dairy cows and chickens. If you are captured by the demons, you will be doomed to continue providing food and entertainment to the demons until you can no longer exploit them.

"This is Valros-sama. Will Valros-sama have dinner too?"

"No, I'm looking for Zaradi."

Those who noticed Varros entering the hall had various reactions. Those who show their obedience in fear, those who look at them with curiosity, and those who pretend to be indifferent. Valros doesn't care about them at all.

Valros was the initiator of the plan, and because he was a demon with great power, he was only temporarily in charge.

I went around various places and called out to powerful demons like Xevion and Lecelliage, but the demons gathered here now were by no means the only ones who agreed with Varros's plan.

Those who were infatuated with other powerful demons, those who gathered here with ambition, and those who came to seek refuge because they thought they could suck their sweet juices...each of them has their own agenda. Precisely because of such a gathering, those with power will naturally rise to the top.

"Lord Vallos"

As Valros looked around, the person he was looking for approached, a demon in the form of an old man who could be called Valros's deputy - Zaradi. Zaradi breaks down when she sees the jewel in his hand.

"Congratulations. Finally."

"You should say it now. We lost three powerful demons because of the plan I made."

"Huh? Three people...?"

Varros shrugged his shoulders at Zaradi who looked suspicious.

"Including Lynette. That was priceless."

"is that so…"

Varros said to Zaradi, who looked a little depressed.

"I'm not blaming you. I know that my research won't progress unless I'm in Term Wills."

"...No, you're right. If it wasn't for that person, I wouldn't have been able to get started."

Zaradi is now taking over Lynette's research. However, his research is not making any progress. Although there was an environmental problem in that the Transmutation Stones could not be replenished, the hard truth was that the hole Lynette had left was too large.

“-What about the remaining miasma beads?”

A devil's jewel that emits miasma... In other words, one of the miasma beads was released by Lecelliage. There is one thing that Valros has released. And only two remain.

Gardinis was in charge of one side, and Mystra was supposed to be in charge of the cemetery on the other.

"Ah. Mine isn't there yet."

It wasn't Zaradi who answered Varros' question. Valros turns his gaze towards the direction of his voice.

There was someone peeking out from the balcony on the second floor of the hall. A smiling demon in the form of a young man... It's Mystra.

He leans out from the handrail, rotates once, and then comes down.

"...Mustra. You're taking this seriously, aren't you?"

"Of course. But Valros. With your new plan, you won't be able to move until all the seals are broken anyway, right? We just have to make it in time, so it won't make any difference if I try my best on my own. From what I see, It seems like you're losing your strength as well."

Mystra looked at Valros, who was aiming to free him as soon as possible, and shrugged his shoulders.

Varros said, sighing inwardly as Mystra laughed as if making fun of people with her polite and rude attitude.

"That's true, but we need to bring the miasma inside Term Wills in time for the release of the seal."

"There won't be any problem with that. Old Gardinis headed to Terwills with the miasma."

"What did you say?"

There was water in my ears while I was sleeping. Gardinis, who was entrusted with releasing the seal from the Spirit Tree, left Belliondora and headed for Terwills, which can only mean one thing. Gardinis brought out the miasma beads he released without permission. Naturally, the precious catalyst needed to infiltrate the border city was also taken away.

Valros glares at Mystra, showing his displeasure.

“You… you knew that and didn’t report it?”

"Wow. It's obvious that he's also contacted you. That person must be in trouble, too."

Mystra shrugs her shoulders as if the wind is blowing somewhere.

"I'm sure that person is desperate for your seat."

"I won't give it to you. If the plan comes to fruition, there will be no meaning to it. If you want to pretend to be the great mountain commander, I'll give it to you."

"Haha. Isn't it because you don't pay attention to things like that? He thinks it's important to be recognized by those around him and sit on top, and there are many people who hate him for that. …I guess they want to achieve something that surpasses others in their plans.”

So, this is what neither Xevion nor Lecelliage were able to accomplish. Mystra's true intentions are unknown, but Gardinis's is easier to understand. He must have looked at Valros' progress and moved to match him.

“I hope I don’t get too greedy and destroy myself.”

“I would be fine with it if I could live my life as I please, so I don’t really understand how old Gardinis feels.”

What Mystra says is doing whatever he wants is, in short, an uncontrolled slaughter.

Just like the Mystra in front of me... Whether it's Xevion or Gardinis, the more powerful the individual, the stronger I tend to be.

"Not at all. It's a good thing that everyone seems to be having fun."

“Ah, don’t worry, even if I’m released, I won’t be heading to the Term Wills. There are probably other jobs that would be suitable, such as the job of a courier. Why don't you give your body a rest? It will take some time to recover, and in its current state, there's no guarantee that you won't be scratched in the neck by an ambitious demon."

"If you think you can do it, do it. You can't go home if you let him live."

When Valros showed a ferocious smile and caused a miasma to rise, several demons who had been listening intently and watched the exchange hurriedly bowed their heads and disappeared into the crowd of other demons. I could see it. Among them is the face of Gardinis' confidant.

"Haha. Well, in that case, you'll be relieved. Hey, I'm sure the plan will go well."

Mystra laughs at Valros's state, with no trace of sincerity.

Valros seemed to be uncomfortable with Mystra's attitude, so he shook his head and left the hall without replying. Zaradi follows.

"What are you going to do? Gardinis is also in trouble."

Zaradi asks as he follows.

"Nothing. Gardinis won't listen to my orders. It seems like he's willing to do the bare minimum as long as he takes the miasma. If that's the case, whether he lives or dies. , that doesn't matter. More than that.''

"HM"

"Gardinis' confidant remains. Gardinis himself seems to have been making some inexplicable movements, so we shouldn't let our guard down just because he's not there. Let him be on guard."

"Understood"

There, Zaradi showed a warlike smile that was typical of a demon. Valros said that he had told him what he needed to tell him, and he headed straight to his room. Zaradi, who was left in the hallway, quickly ran into the darkness of Belliondora's castle to carry out his orders.

**131 - Banquet day**

In the end, without any excuse from Norman, Malcolm headed towards the marquis' territory, unable to move. It is also confirmed that a letter from Norman was sent. If fraud is confirmed, it will most likely be seized and used as evidence.

"What...? What's going on here!?"

"Dad..."

"No, sir! Please calm down!"

"shut up shut up!"

The marquis's banquet was held as planned.

When I opened the lid, there were no invited guests at all. The Marquis finally lost his temper, perhaps unable to endure the guests who never came and the deserted hall of the mansion.

Well, under these circumstances, there are people who are going to hold a banquet as planned. Since they had distributed invitations on a large scale and received King Melvin's consideration, there might be no reason not to hold a banquet.

And this situation... was something that had been expected to some extent, but even with that in mind, the fact that no one came seemed to have caused great damage to the Marquis.

Rumors had been circulating for some time that the Marquis family was not doing well. Even if you hold a dinner party or a ball, only small items will be gathered. It was said that the country was on the decline due to a decline in its influence, but the fact that the rumor that an inspection would be carried out spread as reliable information was fatal.

On the surface, the conversation proceeded in an amicable manner, but the unspoken people gossiped about whether the Marquis family was okay. Of course.

According to Malcolm's report, if he attended a banquet for the marquess during this period, he would be suspected of his relationship with the marquis, and he avoided it for fear of displeasing the royal family and causing unnecessary sparks, resulting in this tragic situation. That's why.

As for me, of course I wasn't attending. There's no way I would.

Since it was about that marquis, I was a little worried that he might make a mistake and say that he would make his successor a Norman, so I just sent Caduceus to check on him just to be sure. Apparently, this is an issue that goes beyond the issue of successors.

“If you don’t act so clever!”

When the Marquis puts him on a shelf and stuffs Norman's cheeks, Norman also turns red and yells.

"Don't be stupid! Even if you declare it honestly, you'll spend it all!"

“Are you saying you did the right thing!? What on earth did you do for the territory with the money you made through fraud!?”

If you were to ask me what I did, I'm sure the answer would be that I lined my own pockets. Norman was hit in the wrong place and was at a loss for words for a moment, but then he regained consciousness and screamed with foam at the corners of his mouth.

"Uh, noisy! It's going to be my money anyway! What's wrong with using it like you do!?"

“What are you saying?! There’s no shortage of things to say and you’re doing the same thing!? How important are the connections in Term Wills to this country!”

"You can't see what's around you!"

“Sir, what is your attitude toward your father just now?”

… It was a horrible argument on both sides. In the end, the Marquis, red in the face and furious, grabs onto Norman and they tangle with him. The momentum caused the table to fall over... and just as the two of them were happily covering their heads with the food, the servants rushed to stop them and separate them.

...It seems there is no need to monitor it any further. I decided to quickly bring Caduceus up. I let him escape from the mansion, take the form of a crow in the shade of a tree, and when he flies away, I cut the five-sense link.

Then, I lightly shake my head to get the scene I just saw out of my head. To be frank, it was a sight that I couldn't bear to see. This is why I don't want to do reconnaissance for the Marquis family. For some reason, I feel more mentally exhausted.

Before long, a large crow landed at the window. As the bird's shape melted and collapsed, a black shadow came in through the gap in the window, pooled on the floor, and then took the shape of a black cat.

Grace, who had been embroidering until then, asked if she realized that the work over there was finished now that Caduceus had returned.

“What happened to the Marquis family?”

"...I don't think there will be any problems."

I choose my words a bit and tell Grace and the others. I don't think I want them to listen to the story, such as the fight between the Marquis and Norman.

The scene here is quite peaceful. There is a difference between heaven and hell. Ashley is quietly looking through the school textbook, and Sheila is brushing Lavigne. Irmhild's performance, as usual, has a gentle and calming tone.

“Even the thieves guild has been getting word that it would be better not to get too involved with the marquis family.”

"That means even in the private sector, right? I wonder if merchants are also turning away."

Irmhild tilted her head to Sheila's words.

"I guess. Merchants are the most sensitive to rumors like that."

“However, it looks like things will be tough for Sir Malcolm after this.”

Ashley's expression became a little clouded. Recently, she has been able to communicate with Kennel using a communication device, so it seems that she receives reports and actually discusses territory management policies. So Malcolm's case is probably not someone else's problem for her.

That said, the Barony of Shirn is doing just fine. From the marquis family to the baron family, horizontal connections are created in that area, which makes Ashley even more solid.

"I think it will be difficult, but I hope that His Majesty and father will cooperate to some extent."

“At that time, I will also cooperate.”

Ashley puts her hand on her chest and smiles. The road also continues into Ashley's territory. There are many areas in which Ashley can be involved, such as preferential treatment given to the marquis's transport fleet when passing through the territory.

"In any case, if Malcolm's report comes back, the Marquis' negligence and Norman's fraud will be brought to light. Then, King Melvin will give a message and the matter will be settled."

By having Malcolm himself become the accuser, it becomes easier to issue a clemency judgment against Malcolm. This doesn't mean he has a sweet face.

The advantage of leaving the marquis territory to Malcolm is that it will be easier to deal with the aftermath. There are also rules regarding the treatment of vassals, so it is easier to rule successfully if the vassals are blood relatives. The royal family will also have more influence over the feudal lords, so this is probably something to be welcomed.

When it comes to post-processing, it seems to be more difficult in the south.

The person who will newly rule the south will be the second son of the Grand Duke Debonis, who is the first queen's immediate family. This person is King Melvin's cousin, and is probably the uncle of the Crown Prince and Roy.

The Verdgar royal family is a country with strong royal power due to the boundary labyrinth, but... it becomes a different story when dealing with the highest-ranking aristocrats such as the Grand Dukes and Dukes, who are also relatives of the royal family. It seems like there's a tug of war between forces and things are getting tough.

Having said that, I'm actually like a maternal relative of the royal family...but we're a peaceful family.

Speaking of Marlene, she was sleeping on the sofa wrapped in a blanket, probably tired from practicing the saucer too much. Originally, shrine maidens sometimes pray all day long, so her ability to maintain concentration is extraordinary. Thanks to that, you can improve quickly.

"yeah…"

I run my fingers through Marlene's hair and stroke it lightly. She smiled and let out a small, cute voice, wondering what kind of girl she was dreaming about. Seraphina is also in Marlene's arms. Maybe it was because she was comfortable under her blanket, but she was also breathing heavily in her sleep... It seems that house elves sleep as long as they feel comfortable.

Grace and Ashley chuckled at Marlene and Seraphina's smiling faces.

"Mr. Marlene, I'm glad your throat has healed."

"Before, I couldn't even make a sound like this."

Ashley narrowed her eyes and stroked Marlene's hair.

“…The Marquis family seems to have calmed down, so will it be the labyrinth again from tomorrow?”

"That's right. I need to confirm the location of the sealed door."

...It's a bit daunting to think about conquering the Great Ruin Lake... In order to avoid any hassle on the day the sealed door is released, I need to get used to the environment and battle over there.

But well, since we have aerial combat equipment, it's much better than normal exploration. We have made sure to have enough equipment for each member to deal with the Great Ruin Lake.

"Well... we won't talk about the labyrinth today."

I had just put the turmoil surrounding the Marquis family out of my mind, and when I was thinking about the Great Rotten Lake, I was reminded of the original Mokami.

"That's right. Let's get some rest today and get ready for the exploration tomorrow."

Grace seemed to sense something from my words, and she smiled softly and nodded.

# **The Neighborhood High School Girl, Miss Isezaki, Is the Great Saintess Returned from Another World~ And I, Suddenly Awakened as Her Exclusive Mana Supply Uncle, Travel Between Earth and Another World with Time-Space Magic~ 173. Reward and Return**

Late at night, as I was having a drink on the balcony, Isezaki-san came over.

It seems she couldn’t fall asleep, and perhaps because of that, she appeared a bit nervous.

So, I decided to consult her about the reward for this mission that we still couldn’t decide on, while boasting about my recently learned [Delay Slow] and [Stop Stop].

―As a result, the reward was decided to be “To permanently allocate one-tenth of the net profit, excluding operational costs from the magic stone mine, to Koutarou Matsunaga.”

This was a reward designed to bother Lady Levia as much as possible, proposed enthusiastically by Isezaki-san.

By the way, Isezaki-san’s initial proposal was three-tenths, but I felt sorry for Lady Levia, so I changed it to one-tenth.

Running a territory requires money, and if Grandain falls into crisis again due to a shortage of funds, it would be counterproductive.

Moreover, it seems like she enjoyed the mischief time, and by the time the discussion was over, Isezaki-san seemed relaxed enough to let out a small yawn.

If it was enough of a distraction for her, honestly, any reward would have been fine.

And then, the next morning. Lady Levia and Holly accepted the reward we requested.

Seeing their somewhat stiff faces, it was evident that this was a somewhat painful expense, but if they didn’t refuse, then surely it would be fine. I think we have a relationship where we can have a frank conversation like that. So, we graciously accepted it.

And so, I finally succeeded in obtaining my dream passive income. …Well, it’s still a long way off until I actually receive it.

After a few miscellaneous discussions, the room in the castle that I had been using to check my notes officially became my private room.

From now on, I can use it anytime I jump to another world, and I’m allowed to place furniture and belongings as I like. It seems they will also clean it regularly.

Following Emmy’s inn, this is my base acquired in another world. By the way, the rental contract for Emmy’s inn continues. It’s good to have as many reliable [Dimensional Teleportation] points as possible.

And so, after finishing our discussion, I and Isezaki-san returned to Japan.

It seems Lady Levia will continue to be busy with tasks such as managing the mine and conscription affairs, as well as dealing with Delixir. I think I’ll visit the castle again after a while.

---

The next day, back in Japan.

Isezaki-san headed to school as usual, and I headed to the Isezaki residence first thing in the morning. It has become a regular report meeting with the landlady (guardian).

“Hey, I heard from Seina. It seems like you built a fortress overnight and saved Princess Levia from crisis. Well done, Matsunaga-kun.”

After being shown into the guest room, I shook my head at the landlady, who was swaying his shoulders happily across the table.

“No, no, I couldn’t have done it alone. And I regret putting Seina-san in danger.”

“I’ve always been saying it, right? Seina is already a grown woman. She can handle her own mess. It’s not something you need to worry about, Matsunaga-kun.”

“I can’t quite accept it like that. Seina-san is still a minor.”

It’s a natural story. But for some reason, the landlady smiled happily at my words.

“Hah, as always. That’s what makes you Matsunaga-kun. …Well, anyway, let Seina do as she likes as much as possible. Of course, if you feel that she’s getting in the way, it’s a different story.”

“I’ve never felt like she was getting in the way… I’m really happy that she’s affectionate towards me, and if she’s enjoying the other world, I want to watch over her.”

“Hehe, is that so? Then continue to get along well with Seina from now on. I’ll leave it to you. …Oh, and now that Seina’s story is over, how about you finally tell me about that thing that’s been in your hands since earlier?”

Saying that, the landlady finally turned her attention to the souvenir I brought this time.

“It’s a souvenir from this time. It’s nothing special…”

“Hya-ha! Boring, you say? Recently, everything Matsunaga-kun brings is exciting, isn’t it?”

“Recently”, then what was it like before the transfer to another world…? While thinking about such things, I handed the souvenir to the landlady smoothly. It’s a bit gruesome, but it should be fine for the landlady.

The landlady opened the large leaf I had wrapped and raised her eyebrows with interest as she looked at the lump of meat inside.

“Hmm, hmm, it’s been prepared, but I can tell it’s a bird. But I don’t know what kind of bird it is. …Okay, I give up. What kind of meat is this?”

I answered the landlady who raised both hands in surrender,.

“Yes, this is called Night Raven—”

“Raven? So, you mean, a crow?”

Interrupting my explanation, the landlady leaned forward.

“Yes, to put it bluntly, it’s a monster crow.”

“A crow! A crow, you say!? Fooooo!! That’s awesome! Super cool!!”

The landlady shouted loudly with sparkling eyes. She was ecstatic.

This Night Raven attacked in a flock on the way back from the mine, but was repelled by the members of ‘Stinger.’ It’s a monster that was repelled.

It was about two sizes larger than the crows I knew, and it had a terrifying beak, but according to Regina, it was “quite delicious.” So, I got a portion of it as a souvenir for the landlady.

I already had a sense that the landlady liked this kind of… unusual food.

“Crows are good, very good. It resonates with my heart. I’ve decided, I’m going to throw a crow party tonight and indulge in it. Won’t you join in, Matsunaga-kun?”

“If it’s not a bother, I’d love to.”

I thought she would invite me, so I haven’t eaten it yet. If I’m going to try it, I want it to be something cooked by the landlady or Isezaki-san.

“Haha, looking forward to tonight’s feast. …Oh, by the way, Matsunaga-kun, if there are mice and crows, are there also bat monsters?”

“Huh, bat monsters? They were hanging from the ceiling in the mine we explored…”

Since they rarely attacked unless provoked, we just passed by them.

“Wow, so there are bat monsters after all. I’d love to try eating them too if possible. Like, taking a bite from their heads!”

The landlady made a gesture of biting into an imaginary bat in her hand. It’s too wild.

However, it’s rare for the landlady to make a request like this, and I’d like to fulfill it. But I’ve heard that bats are full of pathogens, so I wonder about that.

I’ve seen people eating bat dishes on TV, so is it okay? Well, it’s another world anyway… Our common sense doesn’t apply here.

“Um, I’m not sure, so I’ll ask someone who knows about that next time.”

“Yes! I’m counting on you!”

The monster specialty store Dornesia Company in the capital might know. I’ve been wanting to go back to the capital, and it might be a good idea to visit the company while I’m at it.

As we continued to talk about monster meat with the landlady for a while, her smartphone began to vibrate. She excused herself to me and picked up her smartphone.

“…Oh, isn’t it Juuzou? What’s up? …Hmm, I see. Well…”

It seems the other party is Juuzou.

“…Oh, if that’s the case, Matsunaga-kun is right in front of me now. Hold on a moment.”

Saying that, the landlady turned on the speaker function of her smartphone.

---

174. **Granddaughter’s Request**

A deep voice emanated from the landlady’s smartphone. It was undoubtedly Juuzou’s, the owner of that cool voice.

“Hello, it’s Matsunaga. What can I do for you?”

“Oh, Matsunaga-kun! Actually, you’ve probably heard, but Riori seems to want to meet Seina-chan.”

Ah, now that you mention it… Aihara mentioned something about wanting to go somewhere with me and Isezaki-san. We put it off because of the Digram Army invasion incident.

“I was thinking of mediating it with my sister-in-law… Matsunaga-kun, are you free? If you don’t mind, could you arrange a meeting between Riori and Seina-chan? Riori would probably be happier meeting you than the old folks.”

“I don’t think that’s necessarily true… But I just finished up something I was busy with. If that’s the case, I’ll make the arrangements soon.”

It’s something Aihara has been asking me about for a while. It wouldn’t be fair to pass it off to Juuzou or the landlady.

“Oh, I see! It’s better for Seina-chan to have acquaintances closer to her age. Sorry, but I’m counting on you.”

“That’s right. Even though the Jounai family has little to do with us now, bl00d ties are still important. Juuzou and I could kick the bucket anytime, so it’s good to have familiar relatives around.”

The landlady also seemed to approve of the idea of the two meeting. For some reason, Isezaki-san also wanted to meet Aihara, so it seemed urgent to finalize the arrangements.

“In that case, I’ll message Aihara right away. I’m at work now, but I’ll get back to you later—”

As I spoke, I typed out a message and sent it to Aihara. Immediately, the phone vibrated, and a message arrived from Aihara. Hey, what about work?

“What? M-Ma-ma-ma? Then we can go anytime! I’ll even take a day off and adjust to Isezaki-chan’s schedule!”

That’s what she said.

I replied, “You don’t need to take a day off. For now, focus on your work,” and ignored the vibrating phone again, turning back to the landlady’s phone.

“It seems Aihara is okay anytime. I’ll also talk to Isezaki-san about it.”

“Understood. Phew… Now I won’t be nagged by Riori.”

Juuzou let out a relieved sigh. It seemed that he felt relieved that his cute granddaughter’s request had been fulfilled, and a burden had been lifted.

“Now that I’m relieved, I’m getting hungry since morning… Oh, Matsunaga-kun, today was the day for monster meat, right?”

“Yes, that’s right. If you let me know your schedule as usual, I’ll come by right away.”

Today was the day I went to sell monster meat to Juuzou. It’s the day I earn the only income in Japanese yen, so it’s a happy day.

“I don’t have any appointments today. You can come anytime that suits you, so let’s coordinate.”

“Ah, I see. In that case, after this—”

“Hold on. If that’s the case, I’ll leave you alone. Go right now using your ‘Dimensional Teleportation,’ won’t you?”

With that, the landlady stood up briskly. In that case, I might as well take her up on his offer.

“Understood. Then I’ll be off for a bit. See you later—”

As I stood up, the landlady walked over to me.

“By the way, could you also take me to Juuzou’s place? I’ve been wanting to experience your ‘Dimensional Teleportation.’ Okay?”

The landlady looked up at me with a grin. Come to think of it, the landlady hadn’t experienced ‘Dimensional Teleportation’ yet. I had no objections either.

“Of course, no problem. Let’s go.”

I touched the landlady’s shoulder and focused.

“Dimensional Teleportation.”

—In the next moment, we were inside the VIP hospital room where Juuzou lived.

The landlady next to me looked around excitedly and her eyes sparkled with excitement.

“Yeah! So this is ‘Dimensional Teleportation’! I’ve heard about it, but it’s amazing to experience it! It’s fantastic!”

“Oh, did Sister-in-law come too?”

Juuzou greeted us as usual, sitting on the expensive-looking sofa. It was our usual spot when I went to sell monster meat.

Seeing Juuzou like that, the landlady squinted with a bored expression.

“What’s up, Juuzou? You’re oddly calm after witnessing such an unbelievable magic. I remember the first time Matsunaga appeared before me, my heart almost jumped out of my chest.”

“Well, yeah. I’ve seen Matsunaga appear and disappear in front of me countless times…”

Juuzou muttered with a distant look, and the landlady shrugged as he listened.

Come to think of it, Juuzou might be the person who has witnessed my Dimensional Teleportation the most up close. Even supernatural phenomena become routine with familiarity.

With that thought in mind, I took out the wild boar meat from my Storage Space and placed it in the fridge, which exuded an aura of luxury, provided in the hospital room.

It’s a bit sad that monster meat doesn’t last long, even when stored in such a fridge, due to the influence of magical elements.

Then, I received payment for this batch from Juuzou. It’s 100,000 yen per week, making it 400,000 yen per month, my current monthly income.

“Thank you as always.”

“I’m the one who should apologize for bothering you as an old man whose only joy is eating. With your abilities, you could earn as much money as you want without taking care of old folks like me.”

As Juuzou frowned while saying that, the landlady chuckled amusingly.

“Of course. Theft, smuggling, illegal dumping, and brokering illegal immigration. If you want to make big money easily, you can earn as much as you want, haha.”

“But those are all crimes… Even if I earn money by doing bad things, my conscience wouldn’t let me rest.”

Well, in reality, selling items from another world for money without declaring it to the country feels like a crime. But even so, smuggling and such are a bit much, right?

“I see, I see. That’s the man I had in mind. But you still haven’t found a way to earn money?”

“Yes, my income still depends solely on you… Although there seem to be various ways to earn money in the other world.”

“Hmm, I see. Let me know when you need money. If there’s anything I can do, I’ll help you anytime, okay?”

“Yes, I’ll appreciate your help when the time comes.”

Juuzou nodded satisfactorily at my response.

“Well then, that’s the end of the money talk. Matsunaga-kun and Sister-in-law have come all this way, so please relax. Oh, right. I got a bit of rare coffee—”

Juuzou stood up from the sofa and headed to the dining room. After that, we were treated to delicious coffee by the landlady, and our visit to the VIP hospital room came to an end.

**Dinner that evening**

While enjoying fried Night Raven at the Isezaki residence, I also informed Isezaki-san about Aihara’s situation. And Isezaki-san readily agreed, so it was decided that the three of us would meet soon.

Isezaki-san’s enthusiasm surprised me more than I expected. Maybe she’s interested in gal fashion?

Isezaki-san turning into a gal… Hmm, I’m not sure if I want to see that or not.

—And so, several more days passed.

I spent some relaxing days and refreshed myself thoroughly.

Then came the weekend. Finally, it was the day for Isezaki-san and Aihara to deepen their friendship.

**Reborn In A World of Chastity Reversal - Chapter 101 - Students Who Have Begun to Change (1) ~No.1~**

It was now the last third of June. The height of the rainy season.

There were more cloudy or rainy days than sunny days, and it felt humid even when they were inside the house.

This was the time when places with a lot of people, such as inside trains, in front of stations, and on large streets, get hot and humid, and the discomfort caused by the stuffy air was at its peak.

However, on that day, as if it were a sunny break during the rainy season, intense sunlight was shining down upon them since the morning.

According to the weather forecast, the maximum temperature was expected to go up to 30 degrees Celsius, but it was expected to rain in the evening.

Yuu remembered how challenging it was to commute to work and school at this time of the year.

However, the current Yuu, or rather, boys in general were blessed due to how scarce they were.

After all, a bus would take them from the front of the apartment to the front of the second school building, so there was no problem even if they didn’t bring an umbrella.

Shuttle buses were not allowed to open their windows, but in return, they were equipped with air-conditioners, so they were comfortable.

When the bus arrived at the school and stopped in front of the entrance to the second school building, the male students on board got off one after another.

Following the second- and third-year students, Yuu got off the bus with Rei, but as soon as he stepped outside, he was greeted with a humid, hot air.

「It’s so hot today, too, isn’t it?」

「You’re right. It’s almost July, after all.」

「Yeah, once the rainy season is over, it’s midsummer. There’s about a month left until summer vacation, huh.」

Shortly after they started walking while having such a conversation, they saw a group of female students waiting in a cluster next to the entrance where a rope had been stretched.

Although the place where they were standing was directly exposed to the sunlight, the girls, dressed in short-sleeved summer uniform that left their arms exposed, were full of energy this morning too, not succumbing to the heat.

After all, the male students who got off the bus were walking right in front of them.

The number of female students waiting for them had been showing an upward trend recently.

When they asked their upperclassmen, they said that every year, the number peaked around the time new students enrolled to the school, started to decline after Golden Week, and suddenly dropped to about half during the rainy season. It increased a little around the time autumn transitioned to winter, but it seemed to be at its lowest around the end of the year.

And yet, even now that they had gotten into the rainy season, it had not decreased at all.

No, it seemed to be decreasing for a period of time, but starting from around mid-June, it took a turn and started to increase.

One more thing.

A scene they had never seen in previous years was unfolding before their eyes.

「「「「「Good morning!」」」」」

「Ou.」

「Good morning. So full of energy since the morning, aren’t you?」

「Morning~…」

「Mm.」

Faced with the energetic greetings from the female students, the male students, although in a varying manner, waved their hands and replied.

Perhaps seeing some familiar faces among the girls, there were even some boys who took the trouble to approach them and exchange a few words with them.

Yuu could think of one reason for this change.

It was the inter-class ball game competition held this month.

Until last year, almost no boys participated, but this year, at Yuu’s suggestion, they decided to have the boys cheer on the class they were in charge of.

In part because they had been provided with a preparatory period, the boys cheered enthusiastically during the actual event, and the further they advanced in each event, the stronger the sense of unity that was formed between the boys and girls.

Yuu had heard from various people that even after the competition was over, the sense of distance between the boys and girls seemed to be shrinking throughout the school due to the cheering connections.

Considering that it was a coeducational school whose purpose was to facilitate boys and girls to get together, this was a good trend, they said.

By the time the third-year students had passed by and entered the second school building, and the second-year students were halfway through, Yuu and Rei stepped into that place.

Today, Yuu was wearing a white polo shirt and beige chino pants. A summer-oriented refreshing-type outfit.

As for Rei, even in this hot and humid season, he was wearing a white long-sleeved shirt and black slacks, which were close to formal attire. Perhaps because he had sensitive skin, he tended to hide it as much as possible.

However, coupled with his androgynous features, the girls seemed to find it irresistible in its own way.

As soon as they caught sight of the two, the high-pitched cheers immediately intensified.

「「「Kyaaaaaaaaa!」」」

「It’s Hirose-kun!」

「Higashino-kun!」

「Hirose-kun, you look really cool today too~」

「When it comes to cuteness, as expected it has to be Higashino-kun!」

「It’s, as amazing as always, isn’t it?」

Rei was a little taken aback, but as expected, after nearly three months, he had gotten used to it.

He showed no signs of being frightened by the voices of so many girls like he was at the beginning.

「Yeah, but it doesn’t feel bad, right?」

「Well, since I was always with you, Yuu-kun, I inevitably got used to it, or rather…」

Having been watching Yuu who, forgot being clam, enjoyed interacting with girls up close, it seemed that he had been influenced by him.

As such, Yuu and Rei casually approached the girls, who were standing in a row, from the closest end.

Yuu noticed that he recognized the faces of the girls who were lined up there with smiles filled with anticipation.

It was a group of about 7 or 8 girls from class 1-5 that participated in the dodgeball competition.

「「「Good morning! Hirose-kun!」」」

「Good morning.」

As he greeted them, he extended his hand and shook hands with them one by one.

Somehow, he felt like he was a celebrity that was interacting with his fans.

Most boys stopped at only waving their hands or lightly touching a few girls in the front row, but Yuu alone shook hands with any girls who extended their hands to him, not missing even a single one regardless of who the other party was.

While holding her hand, Yuu carefully observed the girl he was shaking hands with.

On the other hand, the girls were also looking at Yuu thoroughly from head to foot with feverish eyes.

Yuu was the only one who spent a lot of time interacting with them one by one.

That was also the reason for his increasing popularity.

Perhaps influenced by Yuu, Rei was also shaking hands with several tall girls from a little distance away.

「Did I shake hands with everyone?」

「H, Hirose-kun! I’m, not yet…」

Aramaki Yoshie, a member of the Class 1-5 class committee, was jumping up and down with her hand outstretched in the back row.

「Yocchan, this way.」

A girl in the front row opened up a place for her, so Yoshie came forward while thanking her.

Sweat was already glistening on Yoshie’s forehead, and her long black hair, which was tied in a half-up braid, had ended up getting a little disheveled.

「U, umm… Hirose-kun, good morning.」

Taking the hand she timidly extended to him, Yuu shook hands with her.

「Good morning, Aramaki-san. Your hair that you’ve taken the trouble of styling is getting disarrayed, you know?」

Yuu stroked Yoshie’s hair with his other hand, brushing the ones sticking on her cheeks to the back.

Feeling his hand touching her face as he did so, Yoshie’s cheeks turned even redder.

「Hau…」

「That hairstyle, I think it suits you well. It’s very cute.」

「「「Ooh…」」」

For some reason, an uproar arose from those around them.

「T-t-t-, thank… you. H, Hirose-kun…」

The eyes behind her glasses were sparkling as she stared at Yuu, and it looked as if a heart symbol was floating on them.

Personally, Yuu also harbored goodwill toward Yoshie, a very earnest class rep type of person.

He even had the desire to do naughty stuff with her someday.

The shortening of distance between boys and girls through each grade had also affected Yuu.

In the past, Yuu was the only first-year boy who got along well with girls, but nowadays, like his classmates Rei and Haruto, the number of boys who grew less resistant to interacting with girls was gradually going up.

As such, he was not as overly standing out as before.

Even so, Yuu, who didn’t detest touching them and always smiled at them, was a special existence to the female students.

Even after he was done with the girls from class 1-5, Yuu greeted back the girls who called out his name, and slowly moved on while exchanging handshakes and high-fives with them.

While some of the girls there were regulars with whom he had gotten acquainted, there were also some whom he had seen for the first time.

Eventually, as he neared the end of the line, a group of tall girls called out his name simultaneously.

Rei had already entered the school building first.

「Huh? If I remember correctly… you girls are form class 1-1, the ones who participated in the volleyball competition, right?」

「That’s right. So you remember us?」

「You know, at that time, we couldn’t help but feel jealous of the class 1-5 that was so enthusiastically cheered on by you, Hirose-kun.」

「Ahaha. Well, I was in charge of their class, after all.」

The six girls there were the players from the class 1-1 that won against class 1-5 in the finals of the volleyball section of the inter-class ball time competition.

Half of them were clearly taller than Yuu, maybe 175-180cm.

They seemed to belong to some kind of athletic club, and even from over their uniforms, he could tell that they had toned bodies.

They also had the characteristic of sporting hairstyles that wouldn’t get in the way of their athletic activities, like short hair or simply tying it into a single bundle.

In spite of that, like any other Sairyou’s students, each and every one of them fell into the cute category.

Perhaps they weren’t too used to being around boys, when Yuu approached them and took their hands in turn, their faces were bright red as they showed a happy look on their faces.

「You see, Hirose-kun… Umm…」

「Hmm, what is it?」

When he was done shaking hands with all of them, the tallest girl, probably the representative, stammered as she spoke to him.

This might be the first time he had met these girls here.

Perhaps they had waved at each other, but Yuu had no recollection of it.

「We’ve only been watching you from afar, but…」

「Is that so? You could’ve just talked to me casually, though.」

「Ahaha. We did think you would say that, Hirose-kun, but…」

「As you can see, there are a lot of competitors, after all.」

「「「Yup, yup.」」」

They all nodded their heads.

True enough, when Yuu walked outside the school building or along the connecting passageway during break time, girls would quickly spot him and talk to him.

The most frequent ones were as expected the girls from class 1-5, including Youko and Kazumi.

It seemed that they had no thought about pushing the group of girls surrounding Yuu away to talk to him.

「So, umm…this.」

「Me too」

「Me too, me too.」

What the six of them handed out to him one after another were letters, each with cute colors and designs.

Of course, Yuu’s name was written on the addressee.

「W, will you accept it?」

「Of course. I’ll gratefully accept it.」

Yuu accepted the letters one by one.

「Well then, it’s almost time for homeroom to start, after all.」

「Y, you’re right. Thank you for today. Hirose-kun.」

「Likewise, I’m glad to be able to talk to you. And thank you for the letters.」

When Yuu expressed his thanks in such a manner, all the girls from class 1-1 showed a relieved smile.

It must have taken a major decision to give a letter to someone of the opposite sex for the first time.

Before his rebirth, Yuu himself had once sent a love letter to a girl in his class on whom he had a single-sided crush just before he graduated from middle school.

Unfortunately, however, the answer was, 「Let’s be good friends」.

This time, his position was that of the recipient of the letter, and he was happy that they had taken the trouble to write one and give it to him.

Though, this was the first time he had received letters from six girls at the same time.

---

It was break time after the first period.

Yuu was taking out the letters he received this morning.

As expected, he couldn’t open and read them in the classroom, as there were public eyes.

What Yuu had spread out was an A5 size memo pad.

Starting with the first boys-girls social event in April, where the boys went around each class to introduce themselves, the number of girls who approached him had been too large, so he decided to take note of them.

This time, he wrote down the traits of each sender, such as their distinctive characteristics and the impression he had on them as he talked to them, on the back of the letter.

It was something from when he was working in a sales position at a company he had joined as a new graduate prior to his rebirth.

He was taught by his senior that after exchanging business cards, it was a good idea to write down the person’s characteristics and impressions on the back.

When you met multiple people at the same time, unless they left a very strong impression on you, you tended to end up forgetting them as time passed.

As such, if you made a note of them before you forgot, it would be easier to match the face and name when you met them again.

If the other party was someone from the same class as you, it would be easy to remember them, in fact, Yuu had pretty much memorized the names of all boys in his class.

However, there were seven classes-worth of girls, so it was pretty difficult to memorize them after only meeting them once.

Thus, it was a habit that he had started based on his past memories.

「Wow! Yuu-kun, that’s amazing. You received six letters today.」

Done preparing for the next class, Rei, who was sitting in front of Yuu, turned around and let out a cry of surprise.

「I guess. Though, this is my first-time receiving letters from six girls at the same time, so I’m taking note of them like this so I don’t forget.」

「Heh~, you’re a surprisingly sincere guy, aren’t you?」

「It’s rare to find a man who is so sincere in his relationships with women.」

「Isn’t it fine? They’ve taken the trouble to give me letters, after all. At times like this, we must not forget to be grateful.」

Joining the conversation between Yuu and Rei were Yamada Masaya and Houshou Haruto, who was sitting behind Yuu.

In addition to Rei and Masaya, he had also gotten close with Haruto through the inter-class ball game competition, and right now, they had gotten close enough to call each other by name.

There, the topic of their conversation turned to how many letters they had received so far.

Rei had received more than 30 letters in total. Mostly from the tall girls in the volleyball and basketball club, including Satou Risa and Ukawa Miyoko.

As for Haruto, the number of letters he received had risen rapidly after the inter-class ball game competition, reaching 20.

It seemed that they were not only from girls from class 1-5, but also from each of the first-year classes.

Masaya didn’t say it clearly.

「At any rate, you must’ve received one from the girl from the concert band club, no?」

When Yuu made such a comment, he replied in an evasive manner and looked away.

As for Yuu, he lied about the exact number, but if we include the ones he received today, the total should have reached 100.

They were mostly from girls from class 1-5, but like today, there were times when he received them from students from other classes, and there were also times when he received them from second-year students he met for the first time.

Speaking of the content of the letters, those who openly expressed their feelings were in the minority.

Given that he was still only a first-year, they were probably refraining from doing so.

They included everyday topics such as home situation and school, but the focus was on self-appeal.

Their goal was probably to let him know about them first.

On top of that, they ended it with: Please let me talk to you if we meet at school.

There were also cases where the girls he had come into contact with, like Youko and Kazumi, praised him like crazy, which he found embarrassing.

He thought it would be difficult to reply if he received that many letters.

In fact, when Yuu started receiving it in mid-April, he gave it some serious thoughts.

How should he respond to the dozens of letters he received from the girls?

Considering his past, this was an extravagant worry.

As a matter of fact, from when they first enrolled at the school until the end of Golden Week, second- and third-year boys visited their classroom during homeroom period and gave them various lectures on how to carry themselves in a co-ed school.

Even though it was safer inside the school than outside, Yuu quickly went and broke the advice that they should act in a group as much as possible.

When Yuu, who had already received more than 10 letters, asked about it, all the seniors who visited their classroom at that time replied that there was no need to reply.

Strictly speaking, it was up to the person himself and he could write a reply if he wanted, but if he did, the girls would become ecstatic, and there would be no end of it, forcing him to go through an awful experience.

As such, the safest option would be to stop at just reading it.

They should just think of it as something like a fan letter, so to speak.

Also, speaking of other means of contact other than letters, there was the home landline phone, but they were warned never to give anyone their phone number unless it was someone with whom they had committed their future.

This was a story from another co-ed school, but as a result of giving it to three girls with whom he had casually become friends, a certain boy’s phone number became widespread in the blink of an eye, and he was plagued by call flooding for a while.

As expected, the person to whom Yuu had given his phone number was Sayaka and Sayaka only. That was because he judged that she could be trusted.

As the days passed, the number of letters with love letter-like content increased, but so far Yuu had not written any replies. Or rather, it could be said that he had received so many letters that he had no leeway to write replies.

In return, he tried to memorize the girls he had received letters from as much as possible, and said a few words to them when he met them in the morning or during break time.

Even with only that, the girls were moved and delighted.

The reason why Yuu was the most popular boy in the first-year boys’ class was because in addition to his look, he was friendly toward girls and would put up such an effort for them.

Although most of them didn’t go as far as confessing their love, Yuu believed that he had received no less than 100 letters that clearly expressed their goodwill.

So far, the only people he had gotten into physical relationships with at school were the three members of the student council and Youko and Kazumi from Class 1-5, for a total of five people, but he thought it would probably be a good idea for him to lay his hands on them more proactively.

It was by no means because he was dissatisfied with only five.

However, now that he had been reborn as a beautiful boy in such a world and was receiving goodwill from numerous girls, there was no way he could afford not to take advantage of it.

This was because even when Yuu touched their bodies, let alone finding it unpleasant, they were delighted by it.

To that end, however, there was the issue of location.

When he did it with Sayaka and the others, they had the student council waiting room.

When he did it with Youko and Kazumi, Yuu couldn’t hold back and ended up doing it in the bathroom.

Was there no convenient place within the school where they could do naughty stuff without anyone finding out…?
